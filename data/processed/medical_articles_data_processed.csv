adrenoleukodystrophy: survey of 303 cases: biochemistry, diagnosis, and therapy.;adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) is a genetically determined disorder associated with progressive central demyelination and adrenal cortical insufficiency . all affected persons show increased levels of saturated unbranched very-long-chain fatty acids , particularly hexacosanoate ( c26  0 ) , because of impaired capacity to degrade these acids . this degradation normally takes place in a subcellular organelle called the peroxisome , and ald , together with zellwegers cerebrohepatorenal syndrome , is now considered to belong to the newly formed category of peroxisomal disorders . biochemical assays permit prenatal diagnosis , as well as identification of most heterozygotes . we have identified 303 patients with ald in 217 kindreds . these patients show a wide phenotypic variation . sixty percent of patients had childhood ald and 17 % adrenomyeloneuropathy , both of which are x-linked , with the gene mapped to xq28 . neonatal ald , a distinct entity with autosomal recessive inheritance and points of resemblance to zellwegers syndrome , accounted for 7 % of the cases . although excess c26  0 in the brain of patients with ald is partially of dietary origin , dietary c26  0 restriction did not produce clear benefit . bone marrow transplant lowered the plasma c26  0 level but failed to arrest neurological progression . .;0;1;1;0

the interpeduncular nucleus regulates nicotine's effects on free-field activity.;partial lesions were made with kainic acid in the interpeduncular nucleus of the ventral midbrain of the rat. compared with sham-operated controls, lesions significantly (p < 0.25) blunted the early (<60 min) free-field locomotor hypoactivity caused by nicotine (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.m.), enhanced the later (60-120 min) nicotine-induced hyperactivity, and raised spontaneous nocturnal activity. lesions reduced the extent of immunohistological staining for choline acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus (p <0.025), but not for tyrosine hydroxylase in the surrounding catecholaminergic a10 region. we conclude that the interpeduncular nucleus mediates nicotinic depression of locomotor activity and dampens nicotinic arousal mechanisms located elsewhere in the brain.;0;0;1;0

effects of suprofen on the isolated perfused rat kidney.;"although suprofen has been associated with the development of acute renal failure in greater than 100 subjects, the mechanism of damage remains unclear. the direct nephrotoxic effects of a single dose of 15 mg of suprofen were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell-free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg/dl of uric acid. there were no significant differences in renal sodium excretion, oxygen consumption, or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with suprofen compared with the drug-free control groups. in contrast, a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of suprofen to the kidney perfused with uric acid; no changes were found with suprofen in the absence of uric acid. a significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of uric acid was found in rats given suprofen, compared with drug-free controls. however, the fractional excretion of uric acid was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period. in summary, suprofen causes acute declines in renal function, most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of uric acid.";0;1;0;0

potential therapeutic use of the selective dopamine d1 receptor agonist, a-86929: an acute study in parkinsonian levodopa-primed monkeys.;the clinical utility of dopamine (da) d1 receptor agonists in the treatment of parkinson's disease (pd) is still unclear. the therapeutic use of selective da d1 receptor agonists such as skf-82958 (6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1h-3-benzaze pine hydrobromide) and a-77636 ([1r, 3s] 3-[1'-admantyl]-1-aminomethyl-3,4-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1h-2-benzo pyran hydrochloride) seems limited because of their duration of action, which is too short for skf-82958 (< 1 hr) and too long for a-77636 (> 20 hr, leading to behavioral tolerance). we therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp)-exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit levodopa-induced dyskinesias to evaluate the locomotor and dyskinetic effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) of a-86929 ([-]-[5ar,11bs]-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-2-propyl-3-thia-5-+ ++azacyclopent-1- ena[c]phenathrene-9-10-diol), a selective and full da d1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action. levodopa and the da d2-like receptor agonist, ly-171555 ([4ar-trans]-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-o-dihydro-5n-propyl-2h-pyrazo lo-3-4-quinoline hydrochloride) were also used for comparison. acute administration of a-86929 was as efficacious in alleviating mptp-induced parkinsonism as levodopa and ly-171555, but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa-induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either ly-171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa. selective stimulation of the da d1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (referred to as the basal ganglia output) compared with levodopa and selective da d2 receptor agonist. potent da d1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as a-86929 (approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested) are potential therapeutic tools in pd and merit further attention.;0;0;1;0

hypertensive response during dobutamine stress echocardiography.;among 3,129 dobutamine stress echocardiographic studies, a hypertensive response, defined as systolic blood pressure (bp) > or = 220 mm hg and/or diastolic bp > or = 110 mm hg, occurred in 30 patients (1%). patients with this response more often had a history of hypertension and had higher resting systolic and diastolic bp before dobutamine infusion.;1;0;0;0
levodopa-induced dyskinesia and thalamotomy.;levodopa-induced dyskinesia of the limbs in thirteen cases of parkinsonism, which was choreic, ballistic or dystonic in type, was alleviated almost completely by stereotaxic surgery using a microelectrode technique for the ventralis oralis anterior and posterior nuclei of the thalamus, but much less by the ventralis intermedius nucleus. control of levodopa-induced dyskinesias by thalamic lesions in the course of routine treatment of parkinsonism is discussed.;0;0;1;0

patterns of sulfadiazine acute nephrotoxicity.;sulfadiazine acute nephrotoxicity is reviving specially because of its use in toxoplasmosis in hiv-positive patients. we report 4 cases, one of them in a previously healthy person. under treatment with sulfadiazine they developed oliguria, abdominal pain, renal failure and showed multiple radiolucent renal calculi in echography. all patients recovered their previous normal renal function after adequate hydration and alcalinization. a nephrostomy tube had to be placed in one of the patients for ureteral lithiasis in a single functional kidney. none of them needed dialysis or a renal biopsy because of a typical benign course. treatment with sulfadiazine requires exquisite control of renal function, an increase in water ingestion and possibly the alcalinization of the urine. we communicate a case in a previously healthy person, a fact not found in the recent literature. probably many more cases are not detected. we think that a prospective study would be useful.;0;1;0;0

haplotype and phenotype analysis of six recurrent brca1 mutations in 61 families: results of an international study.;several brca1 mutations have now been found to occur in geographically diverse breast and ovarian cancer families . to investigate mutation origin and mutation-specific phenotypes due to brca1 , we constructed a haplotype of nine polymorphic markers within or immediately flanking the brca1 locus in a set of 61 breast / ovarian cancer families selected for having one of six recurrent brca1 mutations . tests of both mutations and family-specific differences in age at diagnosis were not significant . a comparison of the six mutations in the relative proportions of cases of breast and ovarian cancer was suggestive of an effect ( p = . 069 ) , with 57 % of women presumed affected because of the 1294 del 40 brca1 mutation having ovarian cancer , compared with 14 % of affected women with the splice-site mutation in intron 5 of brca1 . for the brca1 mutations studied here , the individual mutations are estimated to have arisen 9-170 generations ago . in general , a high degree of haplotype conservation across the region was observed , with haplotype differences most often due to mutations in the short-tandem-repeat markers , although some likely instances of recombination also were observed . for several of the instances , there was evidence for multiple , independent , brca1 mutational events .;0;0;0;1
ataxin-3 with an altered conformation that exposes the polyglutamine domain is associated with the nuclear matrix.;"spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 or machado-joseph disease ( sca3 / mjd ) is a member of the cag / polyglutamine repeat disease family . in this family of disorders , a normally polymorphic cag repeat becomes expanded , resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product . experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis ; however , the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear . here we demonstrate that ataxin-3 , the disease protein in sca3 / mjd , adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells . the monoclonal antibody 1c2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine , but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin-3 containing a normal glutamine repeat . in addition , expression of ataxin-3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full-length non-pathological protein , allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1c2 . fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin-3 is not due to proteolysis , suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein ( s ) alters the structure of full-length ataxin-3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain . this conformationally altered ataxin-3 is bound to the nuclear matrix . the pathological form of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix . these data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of sca3 / mjd may be an altered conformation of ataxin-3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain . .";0;0;1;0

fluoxetine improves the memory deficits caused by the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil.;cancer patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deteriorations in cognition. a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-fu), readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function. in particular this anti mitotic drug could reduce cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain. in contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the ssri antidepressant fluoxetine. in this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic (two week) treatment with 5-fu and (three weeks) with fluoxetine either separately or in combination with 5-fu were tested on adult lister hooded rats. behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test (cer) which showed that animals treated with 5-fu had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls. a separate group of animals was tested using a hippocampal dependent spatial working memory test, the object location recognition test (olr). animals treated only with 5-fu showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the olr task but co administration of fluoxetine improved their performance. 5-fu chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls. this reduction was eliminated when fluoxetine was co administered with 5-fu. fluoxetine on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behaviour. these findings suggest that 5-fu can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine.;0;0;1;1
comparative genome mapping of the ataxia-telangiectasia region in mouse, rat, and syrian hamster.;chromosomal locations of the atm ( ataxia-telangiectasia ( at ) -mutated ) and acat1 ( mitochondrial acetoacetyl-coa thiolase ) genes in mouse , rat , and syrian hamster were determined by direct r-banding fish . both genes were colocalized to the c-d band of mouse chromosome 9 , the proximal end of q24 . 1 of rat chromosome 8 , and qa4-qa5 of syrian hamster chromosome 12 . the regions in the mouse and rat were homologous to human chromosome 11q . fine genetic linkage mapping of the mouse at region was performed using the interspecific backcross mice . atm , acat1 , and npat , which is a new gene isolated from the at region , and 12 flanking microsatellite dna markers were examined . no recombinations were found among the atm , npat , acat1 , and d9mit6 loci , and these loci were mapped 2 . 0 cm distal to d9mit99 and 1 . 3 cm proximal to d9mit102 . comparison of the linkage map of mouse chromosome 9 ( mmu9 ) and that of human chromosome 11 ( hsa11 ) indicates that there is a chromosomal rearrangement due to an inversion between ets1 and atm-npat-acat1 and that the inversion of mmu9 originated from the chromosomal breakage at the boundary between gria4 and atm-npat-acat1 on hsa11 . this type of inversion appeared to be conserved in the three rodent species , mouse , rat , and syrian hamster , using additional comparative mapping data with the rck gene;0;0;1;0

optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy.;"purpose: to map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of axonal degeneration in ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography (oct). ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis. a serious complication of ethambutol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. however, early on, when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible, the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss. methods: three subjects with a history of ethambutol (emb)-induced optic neuropathy of short-, intermediate-, and long-term visual deficits were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination. in addition, oct (oct 3000, humphrey-zeiss, dublin, ca) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer (rnfl) analysis protocol. oct interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the rnfl. results: the results were compared to the calculated average rnfl of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using oct, n=661. in all subjects with history of emb-induced optic neuropathy, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant (patient a, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient b, with intermediate visual deficits, 68% loss; patient c, with chronic visual deficits, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26+/-16 microm. there was a combined mean loss of 46% of fibers from the superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants in the (six) eyes of all three subjects (mean average thickness of 55+/-29 microm). in both sets (four) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits (patients b and c), there was an average loss of 79% of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant. conclusions: the oct results in these patients with emb-induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers. this is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo-cellular axons (or small-caliber axons) within the papillo-macular bundle in toxic or hereditary optic neuropathies. oct can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuropathies. additionally, in terms of management of emb-induced optic neuropathy, it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached.";0;1;1;0

role of activation of bradykinin b2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension.;cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension are not clear. the goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate b2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent-labeled dextran before and during phenylephrine-induced acute hypertension in rats treated with vehicle and hoe-140 (0.1 microm). phenylephrine infusion increased arterial pressure, arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent dextran by a similar magnitude in both groups. these findings suggest that disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension is not related to the synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate b2 receptors.;1;0;1;0
the tsg101 tumor susceptibility gene is located in chromosome 11 band p15 and is mutated in human breast cancer.;recent work has identified a mouse gene ( tsg101 ) whose inactivation in fibroblasts results in cellular transformation and the ability to produce metastatic tumors in nude mice . here , we report that the human homolog , tsg101 , which we isolated and mapped to chromosome 11 , bands 15 . 1-15 1-15 . 2 , a region proposed to contain tumor suppressor gene ( s ) , is mutated at high frequency in human breast cancer . in 7 of 15 uncultured primary human breast carcinomas , intragenic deletions were shown in tsg101 genomic dna and transcripts by gel and sequence analysis , and mutations affecting two tsg101 alleles were identified in four of these cancers . no tsg101 defects were found in matched normal breast tissue from the breast cancer patients . these findings strongly implicate tsg101 mutations in human breast cancer;0;0;0;1

light chain proteinuria and cellular mediated immunity in rifampin treated patients with tuberculosis.;light chain proteinuria was found in 9 of 17 tuberculosis patients treated with rifampin. concomitant assay of cellular mediated immunity in these patients using skin test antigen and a lymphokine in vitro test provided results that were different. response to varidase skin test antigen was negative for all eight tuberculosis patients tested, but there occurred a hyper-responsiveness of the lymphocytes of these eight patients to phytomitogen (pha-p). as well as of those of seven other tuberculous patients. this last finding may be related to time of testing and/or endogenous serum binding of rifampin which could have inhibited mitogen activity for the lymphocyte.;0;1;0;0

serial studies of auditory neurotoxicity in patients receiving deferoxamine therapy.;visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion-dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous deferoxamine. twenty-two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4,000 to 8,000 hz and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels. when deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic. audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability. since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated. auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity. based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine. a dose of 50 mg/kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities. with mild toxicity, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg/kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks. moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg/kg per dose with careful monitoring. in those with symptoms of hearing loss, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg/kg per dose. serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction.;0;0;1;0

quinine-induced arrhythmia in a patient with severe malaria.;it was reported that there was a case of severe malaria patient with jaundice who presented with arrhythmia (premature ventricular contraction) while getting quinine infusion was reported. a man, 25 years old, was admitted to hospital with high fever, chill, vomiting, jaundice. the patient was fully conscious, blood pressure 120/80 mmhg, pulse rate 100 x/minute, regular. on admission, laboratory examination showed plasmodium falciparum (++++), total bilirubin 8.25 mg/dl, conjugated bilirubin 4.36 mg/dl, unconjugated bilirubin 3.89 mg/dl, potassium 3.52 meq/l patient was diagnosed as severe malaria with jaundice and got quinine infusion in dextrose 5% 500 mg/8 hour. on the second day the patient had vomitus, diarrhea, tinnitus, loss of hearing. after 30 hours of quinine infusion the patient felt palpitation and electrocardiography (ecg) recording showed premature ventricular contraction (pvc) > 5 x/minute, trigemini, constant type--sinoatrial block, positive u wave. he was treated with lidocaine 50 mg intravenously followed by infusion 1500 mg in dextrose 5%/24 hour and potassium aspartate tablet. quinine infusion was discontinued and changed with sulfate quinine tablets. three hours later the patient felt better, the frequency of pvc reduced to 4 - 5 x/minute and on the third day ecg was normal, potassium level was 3.34 meq/l. he was discharged on 7th day in good condition. quinine, like quinidine, is a chincona alkaloid that has anti-arrhythmic property, although it also pro-arrhythmic that can cause various arrhythmias, including severe arrhythmia such as multiple pvc. administration of parenteral quinine must be done carefully and with good observation because of its pro-arrhythmic effect, especially in older patients who have heart diseases or patients with electrolyte disorder (hypokalemia) which frequently occurs due to vomiting and or diarrhea in malaria cases.;1;0;0;0

amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes during bladder irrigation: an unusual presentation--a case report.;the authors present a case of early (within 4 days) development of torsade de pointes (tdp) associated with oral amiodarone therapy. consistent with other reports this case of tdp occurred in the context of multiple exacerbating factors including hypokalemia and digoxin excess. transient prolongation of the qt during bladder irrigation prompted the episode of tdp. it is well known that bradycardia exacerbates acquired tdp. the authors speculate that the increased vagal tone during bladder irrigation, a vagal maneuver, in the context of amiodarone therapy resulted in amiodarone-induced proarrhythmia. in the absence of amiodarone therapy, a second bladder irrigation did not induce tdp despite hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.;1;0;0;0
thrombotic complications in acute promyelocytic leukemia during all-trans-retinoic acid therapy.;a case of acute renal failure, due to occlusion of renal vessels in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl) treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (atra) and tranexamic acid has been described recently. we report a case of acute renal failure in an apl patient treated with atra alone. this case further supports the concern about thromboembolic complications associated with atra therapy in apl patients. the patients, a 43-year-old man, presented all the signs and symptoms of apl and was included in a treatment protocol with atra. after 10 days of treatment, he developed acute renal failure that was completely reversible after complete remission of apl was achieved and therapy discontinued. we conclude that atra is a valid therapeutic choice for patients with apl, although the procoagulant tendency is not completely corrected. thrombotic events, however, could be avoided by using low-dose heparin.;0;1;1;1

genomic rearrangements of the apc tumor-suppressor gene in familial adenomatous polyposis.;germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) tumor-suppressor gene result in the hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) . almost all apc mutations that have been identified are single-nucleotide alterations , small insertions , or small deletions that would truncate the protein product of the gene . no well-characterized intragenic rearrangement of apc has been described , and the prevalence of this type of mutation in fap patients is not clear . we screened 49 potential fap families and identified 26 different germline apc mutations in 30 families . four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by alu elements . two of these four rearrangements were complex , involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides . of these four rearrangements , one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14 . the fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14 . although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of apc at the genomic dna level , it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14 . these rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cdnas and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually . the identification of a rearrangement that did not alter any coding exons yet affected the splicing further underscores the importance of using cdna for mutation analysis . the identification of four genomic rearrangements among 30 mutations suggests that genomic rearrangements are frequent germline apc mutations . .;0;0;0;1
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a practical review.;"heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) remains under-recognized despite its potentially devastating outcomes. it begins when heparin exposure stimulates the formation of heparin-platelet factor 4 antibodies, which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet particles. thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of hit, with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complications. the prevalence of hit varies among several subgroups, with greater incidence in surgical as compared with medical populations. hit must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for thrombosis and suspected whenever thrombosis occurs after heparin exposure. early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment, as its delay may result in catastrophic outcomes. the treatment of hit mandates an immediate cessation of all heparin exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy, most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibitor. current ""diagnostic"" tests, which primarily include functional and antigenic assays, have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of hit. special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to heparin multiple times during their course of treatment. direct thrombin inhibitors are appropriate, evidence-based alternatives to heparin in patients with a history of hit, who need to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. as heparin remains one of the most frequently used medications today with potential for hit with every heparin exposure, a close vigilance of platelet counts must be practiced whenever heparin is initiated.";1;0;0;0
improvement by denopamine (ta-064) of pentobarbital-induced cardiac failure in the dog heart-lung preparation.;"the efficacy of denopamine, an orally active beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, in improving cardiac failure was assessed in dog heart-lung preparations. cardiac functions depressed by pentobarbital (118 +/- 28 mg; mean value +/- sd) such that cardiac output and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (lv dp/dt max) had been reduced by about 35% and 26% of the respective controls were improved by denopamine (10-300 micrograms) in a dose-dependent manner. with 100 micrograms denopamine, almost complete restoration of cardiac performance was attained, associated with a slight increase in heart rate. no arrhythmias were induced by these doses of denopamine. the results warrant clinical trials of denopamine in the treatment of cardiac failure.";1;0;1;0

minor neurological dysfunction, cognitive development, and somatic development at the age of 3 to 7 years after dexamethasone treatment in very-low birth-weight infants.;the objective of this study was to assess minor neurological dysfunction, cognitive development, and somatic development after dexamethasone therapy in very-low-birthweight infants. thirty-three children after dexamethasone treatment were matched to 33 children without dexamethasone treatment. data were assessed at the age of 3-7 years. dexamethasone was started between the 7th and the 28th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2.35 mg/kg/day. exclusion criteria were asphyxia, malformations, major surgical interventions, small for gestational age, intraventricular haemorrhage grades iii and iv, periventricular leukomalacia, and severe psychomotor retardation. each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor neurological dysfunctions and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a kaufman assessment battery for children and a draw-a-man test. there were no differences in demographic data, growth, and socio-economic status between the two groups. fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group (p<0.01). in the draw-a-man test, the control group showed better results (p<0.001). there were no differences in development of speech, social development, and the kaufman assessment battery for children. after dexamethasone treatment, children showed a higher rate of minor neurological dysfunctions. neurological development was affected even without neurological diagnosis. further long-term follow-up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of dexamethasone on neurological and cognitive development.;0;0;1;0

verapamil withdrawal as a possible cause of myocardial infarction in a hypertensive woman with a normal coronary angiogram.;verapamil is an effective and relatively-safe antihypertensive drug. serious adverse effects are uncommon and mainly have been related to the depression of cardiac contractility and conduction, especially when the drug is combined with beta-blocking agents. we report a case in which myocardial infarction coincided with the introduction of captopril and the withdrawal of verapamil in a previously asymptomatic woman with severe hypertension. possible mechanisms that involve a verapamil-related increase in platelet and/or vascular alpha 2-adrenoreceptor affinity for catecholamines are discussed.;1;0;1;0

continuous infusion tobramycin combined with carbenicillin for infections in cancer patients.;the cure rate of infections in cancer patients is adversely affected by neutropenia (less than 1,000/mm3). in particular, patients with severe neutropenia (less than 100/mm3) have shown a poor response to antibiotics. to overcome the adverse effects of neutropenia, tobramycin was given by continuous infusion and combined with intermittent carbenicillin. tobramycin was given to a total daily dose of 300 mg/m2 and carbenicillin was given at a dose of 5 gm every four hours. there were 125 infectious episodes in 116 cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. the overall cure rate was 70%. pneumonia was the most common infection and 61% of 59 episodes were cured. gram-negative bacilli were the most common causative organisms and 69% of these infections were cured. the most common pathogen was klebsiella pneumoniae and this, together with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, accounted for 74% of all gram-negative bacillary infections. response was not influenced by the initial neutrophil count, with a 62% cure rate for 39 episodes associated with severe neutropenia. however, failure of the neutrophil count to increase during therapy adversely affected response. azotemia was the major side effect recognized, and it occurred in 11% of episodes. major azotemia (serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl or bun greater than 50 mg/dl) occurred in only 2%. azotemia was not related to duration of therapy or serum tobramycin concentration. this antibiotic regimen showed both therapeutic efficacy and acceptable renal toxicity for these patients.;0;1;1;1

midazolam compared with thiopentone as an induction agent.;in patients premedicated with scopolamine + morphine (+5 mg nitrazepam the evening before surgery), the sleep-inducing effect of midazolam 0.15 mg/kg i.v. was clearly slower in onset than that of thiopentone 4.67 mg/kg i.v. somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the midazolam group, but, although apnoea occurred less often in the midazolam group it lasted longer. on the whole, the differences between midazolam and thiopentone had no apparent clinical consequences. midazolam is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia.;1;0;0;0
preservation of renal blood flow during hypotension induced with fenoldopam in dogs.;the introduction of drugs that could induce hypotension with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy. specific dopamine-1, (da1) and dopamine-2 (da2) receptor agonists are now under clinical investigation. fenoldopam mesylate is a specific da1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation. the hypothesis that fenoldopam could be used to induce hypotension and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested. systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively, in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of fenoldopam and sodium nitroprusside in ten dogs under halothane general anaesthesia. mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 +/- 8 per cent from control with infusion of fenoldopam (3.4 +/- 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and 34 +/- 4 per cent with infusion of sodium nitroprusside (5.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) (ns). renal blood flow (rbf) increased during fenoldopam-induced hypotension 11 +/- 7 per cent and decreased 21 +/- 8 per cent during sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension (p less than 0.01). sodium nitroprusside is a non-selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced hypotension. fenoldopam is a selective dopamine-1 (da1) receptor agonist that causes vasodilatation to the kidney and other organs with da1 receptors and preserves blood flow to the kidney during induced hypotension.;1;1;1;0
blockade of endothelial-mesenchymal transition by a smad3 inhibitor delays the early development of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.;"objective: a multicenter, controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy, suggesting that other mechanism(s) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy (diabetic nephropathy). we have previously demonstrated that endothelial-mesenchymal-transition (endomt) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis independently of microalbuminuria in mice with streptozotocin (stz)-induced diabetes. in the present study, we hypothesized that blocking endomt reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy. research design and methods: endomt was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line (mmec) in the presence of advanced glycation end products (ages) and in the endothelial lineage-traceble mouse line tie2-cre;loxp-egfp by administration of ages, with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control. phosphorylated smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation/western blotting and confocal microscopy. blocking studies using receptor for age sirna and a specific inhibitor of smad3 (sis3) were performed in mmecs and in stz-induced diabetic nephropathy in tie2-cre;loxp-egfp mice. results: confocal microscopy and real-time pcr demonstrated that ages induced endomt in mmecs and in tie2-cre;loxp-egfp mice. immunoprecipitation/western blotting showed that smad3 was activated by ages but was inhibited by sis3 in mmecs and in stz-induced diabetic nephropathy. confocal microscopy and real-time pcr further demonstrated that sis3 abrogated endomt, reduced renal fibrosis, and retarded progression of nephropathy. conclusions: endomt is a novel pathway leading to early development of diabetic nephropathy. blockade of endomt by sis3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications.";0;1;0;0

hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen gene expression in rats with acute nephrotic syndrome.;plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin-angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome (ns). in this work the messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) levels of angiotensinogen (ao) were analyzed with the slot-blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues: kidney, heart, brain, and adrenal gland from control, nephrotic, and pair-fed (pf) rats. ns was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino-nucleoside (pan). although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of ao were observed on day 6 after pan injection, when ns was clearly established, hepatic ao mrna levels did not change. furthermore, the ao mrna levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6, nor did its hepatic levels at days 1, 3, 5, or 7 after pan injection. these data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic ao mrna levels are unaltered during the development of the acute ns induced by pan.;1;1;1;0
renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged isoflurane-induced hypotension in humans.;the effect of isoflurane-induced hypotension on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) and effective renal plasma flow (erpf) were measured by inulin and para-aminohippurate (pah) clearance, respectively. anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane. hypotension was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmhg. gfr and erpf decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during hypotension. postoperatively, erpf returned to preoperative values, whereas gfr was higher than preoperative values. renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when hypotension was induced, allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow. we conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane-induced hypotension and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.;0;1;1;0

hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine in inflammatory arthritis: a case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events.;background: spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions (adrs) are handicapped by under-reporting and limited detail on individual cases. we report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure in two of our patients. methods: serious adr reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years. patients', who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious adr, were identified. two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument. the likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions. results: ten cases were identified: eight occurred during surveillance. eight patients were hospitalised, two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transplant. all but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment. seven patients had a skin rash, three eosinophilia and one interstitial nephritis. five patients were of black british of african or caribbean descent. liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six. drug-related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients. the likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0.4% of treated patients. conclusion: serious hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine appears to be under-appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important.;0;1;1;0

continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna to prevent ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.;hemorrhagic cystitis is a major potential toxicity of ifosfamide that can be prevented by administering mesna along with the cytotoxic agent. mesna is generally administered by the intravenous route, although experience with oral delivery of the drug has increased. the continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access. in addition, subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary mesna concentrations, such as in a patient taking oral mesna who experiences severe ifosfamide-induced emesis and is unable to absorb the drug. limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous mesna administration suggests it is a safe, practical, and economic method of drug delivery that permits ifosfamide to be administered successfully in the outpatient setting.;0;1;0;0
penicillamine-induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.;a 67-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (rpgn) after 5 months of d-penicillamine (250 mg/day) treatment. light microscopy study showed severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation in 60% of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole. immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular igg, iga and c3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium. the patient was treated with steroid pulse, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide and antiplatelet agents. a complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks. this new case of rpgn in the course of d-penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patients. the prompt discontinuation of d-penicillamine and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case.;0;1;0;0

the von hippel-lindau tumor suppressor gene is required for cell cycle exit upon serum withdrawal.;the inactivation of the von hippel-lindau ( vhl ) tumor suppressor gene predisposes affected individuals to the human vhl cancer syndrome and is associated with sporadic renal cell carcinomas ( rcc ) and brain hemangioblastomas . vhl-negative 786-0 rcc cells are tumorigenic in nude mice which is suppressed by the reintroduction of vhl . remarkably , this occurs without affecting the growth rate and cell cycle profile of these cells in culture . the 786-0 cell line , like many cancer cells , fails to exit the cell cycle upon serum withdrawal . here , it is shown that reintroduction of the wild-type vhl gene restores the ability of vhl-negative rcc cancer cells to exit the cell cycle and enter g0 / quiescence in low serum . both vhl-positive and vhl-negative rcc cells exit the cell cycle by contact inhibition . the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , p27 , accumulates upon serum withdrawal , only in the presence of vhl , as a result of the stabilization of the protein . we propose that the loss of wild-type vhl gene results in a specific cellular defect in serum-dependent growth control , which may initiate tumor formation . this is corrected by the reintroduction of wild-type vhl , implicating vhl as the first tumor suppressor involved in the regulation of cell cycle exit , which is consistent with its gatekeeper function in the kidney . .;0;1;1;1

anaesthetic complications associated with myotonia congenita: case study and comparison with other myotonic disorders.;myotonia congenita (mc) is caused by a defect in the skeletal muscle chloride channel function, which may cause sustained membrane depolarisation. we describe a previously healthy 32-year-old woman who developed a life-threatening muscle spasm and secondary ventilation difficulties following a preoperative injection of suxamethonium. the muscle spasms disappeared spontaneously and the surgery proceeded without further problems. when subsequently questioned, she reported minor symptoms suggesting a myotonic condition. myotonia was found on clinical examination and emg. the diagnosis mc was confirmed genetically. neither the patient nor the anaesthetist were aware of the diagnosis before this potentially lethal complication occurred. we give a brief overview of ion channel disorders including malignant hyperthermia and their anaesthetic considerations.;0;0;1;0

malignant neoplasms in the families of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.;ataxia-telangiectasia ( a-t ) is an autosomal recessive syndrome associated with a greatly increased incidence of malignant neoplasms in homozygous affected individuals . heterozygotes for the gene for a-t are thought to comprise about 1 % of the general population and , therefore , it is important to know whether this gene also predisposes the heterozygous carrier to cancers . heterozygous carriers of this gene are common among the close relatives of patients with a-t , although individual carriers cannot be identified by any clinical criterion or laboratory test . for this reason , we compared the incidence of death from malignant neoplasms in 2 families of patients with a-t to that expected in a random sample of the general population . there were 59 deaths from malignant neoplasms in relatives dying before age 75 , compared to 42 . 6 expected ( p less than 0 . 02 ) . for a-t heterozygotes younger than age 45 , the risk of dying from a malignant neoplasm was estimated to be greater than 5 times the risk for the general population . a-t heterozygotes may comprise more than 5 % of all persons dying from a cancer before age 45 . the incidence of ovarian , gastric , and biliary system carcinomas and of leukemia and lymphoma was increased in these a-t families . other neoplasms that may be associated with this gene in heterozygotes include pancreatic , basal cell , colonic , breast , and cervical carcinomas .;0;1;1;1
constitutional mutations in the wt1 gene in patients with denys-drash syndrome.;the denys-drash syndrome is characterised by a typical nephropathy , genital abnormalities and also predisposes to the development of wilms tumor . these patients eventually go into end stage renal failure . a candidate wilms tumor gene , wt1 , from the 11p13 chromosome region has recently been cloned . we have analysed the dna sequence in constitutional cells from eight patients and have shown heterozygous mutations in six of them . four of the mutations were in exon 9 , all resulting in missense mutations . three were at nucleotide position 1180 resulting in an arg > trp amino acid change . the other was at position 1186 converting an asp > asn in the predicted resultant protein . one patient had a missense mutation in exon 8 , converting an arg > his . a single base pair insertion at nucleotide position 821 in exon 6 resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon in the last patient . we were unable to find a mutation in one patient despite complete sequencing of the genomic sequence of the gene . the last patient carried a constitutional deletion of the 11p13 region and no additional mutation was found . there was no obvious correlation between the type of mutation and phenotypic expression . these results further demonstrate that the wt1 gene is important in both the development of the kidney and the genito-urinary system . .;0;1;1;1

possible teratogenicity of sulphasalazine.;three infants, born of two mothers with inflammatory bowel disease who received treatment with sulphasalazine throughout pregnancy, were found to have major congenital anomalies. in the singleton pregnancy, the mother had ulcerative colitis, and the infant, a male, had coarctation of the aorta and a ventricular septal defect. in the twin pregnancy, the mother had crohn's disease. the first twin, a female, had a left potter-type iia polycystic kidney and a rudimentary left uterine cornu. the second twin, a male, had some features of potter's facies, hypoplastic lungs, absent kidneys and ureters, and talipes equinovarus. despite reports to the contrary, it is suggested that sulphasalazine may be teratogenic.;0;1;0;0

high-dose methylprednisolone may do more harm for spinal cord injury.;because of the national acute spinal cord injury studies (nascis), high-dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute spinal cord injury. in the nascis, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high-dose methylprednisolone may cause. the dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the nascis 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition. we hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients. further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the nascis may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury. to our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by nascis may cause acute corticosteroid myopathy.;0;0;1;0
incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in hospitalised patients with cancer.;"objectives: to determine the frequency of and possible factors related to contrast-induced nephropathy (cin) in hospitalised patients with cancer. methods: ninety adult patients were enrolled. patients with risk factors for acute renal failure were excluded. blood samples were examined the day before contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ct) and serially for 3 days thereafter. cin was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (cr) of 0.5 mg/dl or more, or elevation of cr to 25 % over baseline. relationships between cin and possible risk factors were investigated. results: cin was detected in 18/90 (20 %) patients. cin developed in 25.5 % patients who underwent chemotherapy and in 11 % patients who did not (p = 0.1). cin more frequently developed in patients who had undergone ct within 45 days after the last chemotherapy (p = 0.005); it was also an independent risk factor (p = 0.017). cin was significantly more after treatment with bevacizumab/irinotecan (p = 0.021) and in patients with hypertension (p = 0.044). conclusions: the incidence of cin after ct in hospitalised oncological patients was 20 %. cin developed 4.5-times more frequently in patients with cancer who had undergone recent chemotherapy. hypertension and the combination of bevacizumab/irinotecan may be additional risk factors for cin development. key points: . contrast-induced nephropathy (cin) is a concern for oncological patients undergoing ct. . cin occurs more often when ct is performed <45 days after chemotherapy. . hypertension and treatment with bevacizumab appear to be additional risk factors.";1;1;0;1

etiology of hypercalcemia in hemodialysis patients on calcium carbonate therapy.;fourteen of 39 dialysis patients (36%) became hypercalcemic after switching to calcium carbonate as their principal phosphate binder. in order to identify risk factors associated with the development of hypercalcemia, indirect parameters of intestinal calcium reabsorption and bone turnover rate in these 14 patients were compared with results in 14 eucalcemic patients matched for age, sex, length of time on dialysis, and etiology of renal disease. in addition to experiencing hypercalcemic episodes with peak calcium values of 2.7 to 3.8 mmol/l (10.7 to 15.0 mg/dl), patients in the hypercalcemic group exhibited a significant increase in the mean calcium concentration obtained during 6 months before the switch, compared with the mean value obtained during the 7 months of observation after the switch (2.4 +/- 0.03 to 2.5 +/- 0.03 mmol/l [9.7 +/- 0.2 to 10.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dl], p = 0.006). in contrast, eucalcemic patients exhibited no change in mean calcium values over the same time period (2.3 +/- 0.05 to 2.3 +/- 0.05 mmol/l [9.2 +/- 0.2 to 9.2 +/- 0.2 mg/dl]). caco3 dosage, calculated dietary calcium intake, and circulating levels of vitamin d metabolites were similar in both groups. physical activity index and predialysis serum bicarbonate levels also were similar in both groups. however, there was a significant difference in parameters reflecting bone turnover rates between groups.(abstract truncated at 250 words);0;1;0;0
lidocaine-induced cardiac asystole.;"intravenous administration of a single 50-mg bolus of lidocaine in a 67-year-old man resulted in profound depression of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers. the patient had no apparent associated conditions which might have predisposed him to the development of bradyarrhythmias; and, thus, this probably represented a true idiosyncrasy to lidocaine.";1;0;0;0

prophylactic lidocaine in the early phase of suspected myocardial infarction.;four hundred two patients with suspected myocardial infarction seen within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms entered a double-blind randomized trial of lidocaine vs placebo. during the 1 hour after administration of the drug the incidence of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia among the 204 patients with acute myocardial infarction was low, 1.5%. lidocaine, given in a 300 mg dose intramuscularly followed by 100 mg intravenously, did not prevent sustained ventricular tachycardia, although there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with warning arrhythmias between 15 and 45 minutes after the administration of lidocaine (p less than 0.05). the average plasma lidocaine level 10 minutes after administration for patients without a myocardial infarction was significantly higher than that for patients with an acute infarction. the mean plasma lidocaine level of patients on beta-blocking agents was no different from that in patients not on beta blocking agents. during the 1-hour study period, the incidence of central nervous system side effects was significantly greater in the lidocaine group, hypotension occurred in 11 patients, nine of whom had received lidocaine, and four patients died from asystole, three of whom had had lidocaine. we cannot advocate the administration of lidocaine prophylactically in the early hours of suspected myocardial infarction.;1;0;1;0
mutation of the kit (mast/stem cell growth factor receptor) protooncogene in human piebaldism.;piebaldism is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by cogenital patches of skin and hair from which melanocytes are completely absent . a similar disorder of mouse , dominant white spotting ( w ) , results from mutations of the c-kit protooncogene , which encodes and receptor for mast / stem cell growth factor . we identified a kit gene mutation in a proband with classic autosomal dominant piebaldism . this mutation results in a gly----arg substitution at codon 664 , within the tyrosine kinase domain . this substitution was not seen in any normal individuals and was completely linked to the piebald phenotype in the probands family . piebaldism in this family thus appears to be the human homologue to dominant white spotting ( w ) of the mouse . .;0;0;0;1
recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus of a murine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.;similar to rats, systemic pilocarpine injection causes status epilepticus (se) and the eventual development of spontaneous seizures and mossy fiber sprouting in c57bl/6 and cd1 mice, but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice. population responses in granule cells of the dentate gyrus were examined in transverse slices of the ventral hippocampus from pilocarpine-treated and untreated mice. in mg(2+)-free bathing medium containing bicuculline, conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices, electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a single population spike in granule cells from control mice and pilocarpine-treated mice that did not experience se. in se survivors, similar stimulation resulted in a population spike followed, at a variable latency, by negative dc shifts and repetitive afterdischarges of 3-60 s duration, which were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. focal glutamate photostimulation of the granule cell layer at sites distant from the recording pipette resulted in population responses of 1-30 s duration in slices from se survivors but not other groups. these data support the hypothesis that se-induced mossy fiber sprouting and synaptic reorganization are relevant characteristics of seizure development in these murine strains, resembling rat models of human temporal lobe epilepsy.;0;0;1;0
cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis associated with oxacillin.;a 67-year-old man who was treated with oxacillin for one week because of staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, developed renal failure and diffuse, symmetric, palpable purpuric lesions on his feet. necrotic blisters were noted on his fingers. skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. oxacillin was discontinued and patient was treated with corticosteroids. the rash disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal. leucocytoclastic vasculitis presents as palpable purpura of the lower extremities often accompanied by abdominal pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement. etiologic factors or associated disorders include infections, medications, collagen vascular disease and neoplasia. however, in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified. usually it is a self-limited disorder, but corticosteroid therapy may be needed in life-threatening cases since early treatment with corticosteroids in severe cases can prevent complications. oxacillin should be included among the drugs that can cause leucocytoclastic vasculitis.;0;1;0;0

association of common genetic variants of homer1 gene with levodopa adverse effects in parkinson's disease patients.;levodopa is the most effective symptomatic therapy for parkinson's disease, but its chronic use could lead to chronic adverse outcomes, such as motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and visual hallucinations. homer1 is a protein with pivotal function in glutamate transmission, which has been related to the pathogenesis of these complications. this study investigates whether polymorphisms in the homer1 gene promoter region are associated with the occurrence of the chronic complications of levodopa therapy. a total of 205 patients with idiopathic parkinson's disease were investigated. patients were genotyped for rs4704559, rs10942891 and rs4704560 by allelic discrimination with taqman assays. the rs4704559 g allele was associated with a lower prevalence of dyskinesia (prevalence ratio (pr)=0.615, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.426-0.887, p=0.009) and visual hallucinations (pr=0.515, 95% ci 0.295-0.899, p=0.020). our data suggest that homer1 rs4704559 g allele has a protective role for the development of levodopa adverse effects.;0;0;1;0

crocin improves lipid dysregulation in subacute diazinon exposure through erk1/2 pathway in rat liver.;"introduction: diazinon yis one of the most broadly used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture. it has been shown that exposure to diazinon may interfere with lipid metabolism. moreover, the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established. earlier studies revealed the major role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) pathways in low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) expression. the aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism, erk and ldlr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute diazinon. furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on diazinon induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied. methods: 24 rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks; corn oil (control), diazinon (15mg/kg per day, orally) and crocin (12.5 and 25mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally) in combination with diazinon (15 mg/kg). the levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and ldl in blood of rats were analyzed. moreover mrna levels of ldlr and erk1/2 as well as protein levels of total and activated forms of erk1/2 in rat liver were evaluated by western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis. results: our data showed that subacute exposure to diazinon significantly increased concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and ldl. moreover diazinon decreased erk1/2 protein phosphorylation and ldlr transcript. crocin reduced inhibition of erk activation and diazinon-induced hyperlipemia and increased levels of ldlr transcript. conclusions: crocin may be considered as a novel protective agent in diazinon-induced hyperlipemia through modulating of erk pathway and increase of ldlr expression.";0;1;1;0

a prospective study of adverse reactions associated with vancomycin therapy.;"a prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vancomycin was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16-month period. vancomycin was curative in 95% of 43 patients with proven infection. drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions; in three of these vancomycin was considered the likely cause. reactions included thrombophlebitis (20 of 54 patients), rash (4 of 54), nephrotoxicity (4 of 50), proteinuria (1 of 50) and ototoxicity (1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry). thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus vancomycin. we conclude that vancomycin, administered appropriately, constitutes safe, effective therapy for infections caused by susceptible bacteria.";0;1;0;0
efficacy of olanzapine in acute bipolar mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. the olanzipine hggw study group.;"background: we compared the efficacy and safety of olanzapine vs placebo for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. methods: four-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel study. a total of 115 patients with a dsm-iv diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 55), or placebo (n = 60). the primary efficacy measure was the young-mania rating scale (y-mrs) total score. response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than 12 at end point in the y-mrs total score, respectively. safety was assessed using adverse events, extrapyramidal symptom (eps) rating scales, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change. results: olanzapine-treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean (+/- sd) improvement in y-mrs total score than placebo-treated patients (-14.8 +/- 12.5 and -8.1 +/- 12.7, respectively; p<.001), which was evident at the first postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout the study (last observation carried forward). olanzapine-treated patients demonstrated a higher rate of response (65% vs 43%, respectively; p =.02) and euthymia (61% vs 36%, respectively; p =. 01) than placebo-treated patients. there were no statistically significant differences in epss between groups. however, olanzapine-treated patients had a statistically significant greater mean (+/- sd) weight gain than placebo-treated patients (2.1 +/- 2.8 vs 0.45 +/- 2.3 kg, respectively) and also experienced more treatment-emergent somnolence (21 patients [38.2%] vs 5 [8.3% ], respectively). conclusion: olanzapine demonstrated greater efficacy than placebo in the treatment of acute bipolar mania and was generally well tolerated.";1;0;1;0

effects of verapamil on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs.;background: atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (af) and decreases l-type ca(2+) current. there is also a clinical suggestion that acute l-type ca(2) channel blockade can promote af, consistent with an af promoting effect of ca(2+) channel inhibition. methods: to evaluate the potential mechanisms of af promotion by ca(2+) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine-chloralose anesthetized dogs. diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nadolol was applied in some experiments. epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during af. results: verapamil caused af promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of af induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-s.e.) to 95+/-39 s (p<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (p<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil. in these experiments, verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period (erp) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (p<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased erp heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, p<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of af (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, p<0.005). diltiazem did not affect erp, af cycle length or af duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil (n=5). in the presence of autonomic blockade, verapamil failed to promote af and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade. epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted af by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. conclusions: verapamil promotes af in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem.;1;0;1;0

cerebrospinal fluid penetration of high-dose daptomycin in suspected staphylococcus aureus meningitis.;objective: to report a case of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) bacteremia with suspected mssa meningitis treated with high-dose daptomycin assessed with concurrent serum and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) concentrations. case summary: a 54-year-old male presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and presumed health-care-associated pneumonia shown on chest radiograph. treatment was empirically initiated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. blood cultures revealed s. aureus susceptible to oxacillin. empiric antibiotic treatment was narrowed to nafcillin on day 4. on day 8, the patient developed acute renal failure (serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dl, increased from 1.2 mg/dl the previous day and 0.8 mg/dl on admission). the patient's glasgow coma score was 3, with normal findings shown on computed tomography scan of the head 72 hours following an episode of cardiac arrest on day 10. the patient experienced relapsing mssa bacteremia on day 9, increasing the suspicion for a central nervous system (cns) infection. nafcillin was discontinued and daptomycin 9 mg/kg daily was initiated for suspected meningitis and was continued until the patient's death on day 16. daptomycin serum and csf trough concentrations were 11.21 ug/ml and 0.52 ug/ml, respectively, prior to the third dose. lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for mssa. creatine kinase levels were normal prior to daptomycin therapy and were not reassessed. discussion: daptomycin was initiated in our patient secondary to possible nafcillin-induced acute interstitial nephritis and relapsing bacteremia. at a dose of 9 mg/kg, resultant penetration of 5% was higher than in previous reports, more consistent with inflamed meninges. conclusions: high-dose daptomycin may be an alternative option for mssa bacteremia with or without a cns source in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate standard therapy. further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted.;0;1;1;0

acute renal insufficiency after high-dose melphalan in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis during stem cell transplantation.;background: patients with primary systemic amyloidosis (al) have a poor prognosis. median survival time from standard treatments is only 17 months. high-dose intravenous melphalan followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant (pbsct) appears to be the most promising therapy, but treatment mortality can be high. the authors have noted the development of acute renal insufficiency immediately after melphalan conditioning. this study was undertaken to further examine its risk factors and impact on posttransplant mortality. methods: consecutive al patients who underwent pbsct were studied retrospectively. acute renal insufficiency (ari) after high-dose melphalan was defined by a minimum increase of 0.5 mg/dl (44 micromol/l) in the serum creatinine level that is greater than 50% of baseline immediately after conditioning. urine sediment score was the sum of the individual types of sediment identified on urine microscopy. results: of the 80 patients studied, ari developed in 18.8% of the patients after high-dose melphalan. univariate analysis identified age, hypoalbuminemia, heavy proteinuria, diuretic use, and urine sediment score (>3) as risk factors. age and urine sediment score remained independently significant risk factors in the multivariate analysis. patients who had ari after high-dose melphalan underwent dialysis more often (p = 0.007), and had a worse 1-year survival (p = 0.03). conclusion: the timing of renal injury strongly suggests melphalan as the causative agent. ongoing tubular injury may be a prerequisite for renal injury by melphalan as evidenced by the active urinary sediment. development of ari adversely affected the outcome after pbsct. effective preventive measures may help decrease the treatment mortality of pbsct in al patients.;0;1;0;0
ovarian cancer risk in brca1 carriers is modified by the hras1 variable number of tandem repeat (vntr) locus.;women who carry a mutation in the brca1 gene ( on chromosome 17q21 ) , have an 80 % risk of breast cancer and a 40 % risk of ovarian cancer by the age of 70 ( ref . 1 ) . the variable penetrance of brca1 suggests that other genetic and non-genetic factors play a role in tumourigenesis in these individuals . the hras1 variable number of tandem repeats ( vntr ) polymorphism , located 1 kilobase ( kb ) downstream of the hras1 proto-oncogene ( chromosome 11p15 . 5 ) is one possible genetic modifier of cancer penetrance . individuals who have rare alleles of the vntr have an increased risk of certain types of cancers , including breast cancer ( 2-4 ) . to investigate whether the presence of rare hras1 alleles increases susceptibility to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer , we have typed a panel of 307 female brca1 carriers at this locus using a pcr-based technique . the risk for ovarian cancer was 2 . 11 times greater for brca1 carriers harbouring one or two rare hras1 alleles , compared to carriers with only common alleles ( p = 0 . 015 ) . the magnitude of the relative risk associated with a rare hras1 allele was not altered by adjusting for the other known risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer ( 5 ) . susceptibility to breast cancer did not appear to be affected by the presence of rare hras1 alleles . this study is the first to show the effect of a modifying gene on the penetrance of an inherited cancer syndrome;0;0;0;1

comparison of the effect of oxitropium bromide and of slow-release theophylline on nocturnal asthma.;the effects of a new inhaled antimuscarinic drug, oxitropium bromide, and of a slow-release theophylline preparation upon nocturnal asthma were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind study. two samples were studied: 12 patients received oxitropium at 600 micrograms (6 subjects) or at 400 micrograms t.i.d. (6 subjects) whereas 11 received theophylline at 300 mg b.i.d. morning dipping, assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight, was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken, whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration. no significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug, as well as with either dosage of oxitropium. no subject reported side effects of oxitropium, as compared to three subjects reporting nausea, vomiting and tremors after theophylline. oxitropium proves to be a valuable alternative to theophylline in nocturnal asthma, since it is equally potent, safer and does not require the titration of dosage.;0;0;1;0

hormones and risk of breast cancer.;"this paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy. the majority (29) had surgical menopause; their mean age was 45.7 years. it was hypothesized that progestins could equilibrate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy. the treatment schedule consisted of conjugated estrogens (premarin) 1.25 mg/day for 21 days and medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 10 days in each month. the mean treatment period was 18 months. during the follow-up period, attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography. mastodynia was reported by 21 patients, and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women. themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate mastodynia and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe mastodynia. normalization was obtained by halving the estrogen dose. these results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied: 1) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical, metabolic, cytologic, and mammographic perspective; 2) cyclic treatment schedule, with a progestative phase of 10 days; and 3) periodic complete follow-up, with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues.";0;0;0;1

serotonin syndrome from venlafaxine-tranylcypromine interaction.;excessive stimulation of serotonin 5ht1a receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering, muscle rigidity, salivation, confusion, agitation and hyperthermia. the most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor. venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. we report a venlafaxine-maoi interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. he had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of venlafaxine. within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity. he was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis. his pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 f. after 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws. he was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation, and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity. his subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune thrombocytopenia which resolved. the patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 f and his cpk remained < 500 units/l with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis. his mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward. this patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis.;1;0;1;0
indomethacin-induced renal insufficiency: recurrence on rechallenge.;we have reported a case of acute oliguric renal failure with hyperkalemia in a patient with cirrhosis, ascites, and cor pulmonale after indomethacin therapy. prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal, while re-exposure to a single dose of indomethacin caused recurrence of acute reversible oliguria. our case supports the hypothesis that endogenous renal prostaglandins play a role in the maintenance of renal blood flow when circulating plasma volume is diminished. since nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents interfere with this compensatory mechanism and may cause acute renal failure, they should be used with caution in such patients.;0;1;0;0
transvenous right ventricular pacing during cardiopulmonary resuscitation of pediatric patients with acute cardiomyopathy.;"we describe the cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts on five patients who presented in acute circulatory failure from myocardial dysfunction. three patients had acute viral myocarditis, one had a carbamazepine-induced acute eosinophilic myocarditis, and one had cardiac hemosiderosis resulting in acute cardiogenic shock. all patients were continuously monitored with central venous and arterial catheters in addition to routine noninvasive monitoring. an introducer sheath, a pacemaker, and sterile pacing wires were made readily available for the patients, should the need arise to terminate resistant cardiac dysrhythmias. all patients developed cardiocirculatory arrest associated with extreme hypotension and dysrhythmias within the first 48 hours of their admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (picu). right ventricular pacemaker wires were inserted in all of them during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr). in four patients, cardiac pacing was used, resulting in a temporary captured rhythm and restoration of their cardiac output. these patients had a second event of cardiac arrest, resulting in death, within 10 to 60 minutes. in one patient, cardiac pacing was not used, because he converted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical defibrillation within three minutes of initiating cpr. we conclude that cardiac pacing during resuscitative efforts in pediatric patients suffering from acute myocardial dysfunction may not have long-term value in and of itself; however, if temporary hemodynamic stability is achieved by this procedure, it may provide additional time needed to institute other therapeutic modalities.";1;0;0;0

an amino-acid substitution involved in phenylketonuria is in linkage disequilibrium with dna haplotype 2.;phenylketonuria ( pku ) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah , phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase , ec 1 . 14 . 16 . 1 ) . pku is a common inborn error of amino-acid metabolism in caucasian populations and approximately 1 in 50 individuals are carriers of a pku allele . to define the molecular basis of pku , we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism ( rflp ) haplotypes of the pah locus in the northern european population and observed that 90 % of the pku alleles in this population are confined to four common rflp haplotypes . we have recently reported a splicing mutation in the pah gene that is associated with rflp haplotype 3 which is present at about 40 % of mutant alleles . we now report the molecular lesion associated with the rflp haplotype 2 mutant allele . this defect is caused by a c-to-t transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution ( arg to trp ) at residue 408 of pah . direct hybridization analysis of the point mutation using a specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with rflp haplotype 2 alleles that make up about 20 % of mutant pah genes;0;1;0;0
targeted disruption of atm leads to growth retardation, chromosomal fragmentation during meiosis, immune defects, and thymic lymphoma.;atm , the gene mutated in the inherited human disease ataxia-telangiectasia , is a member of a family of kinases involved in dna metabolism and cell-cycle checkpoint control . to help clarify the physiological roles of the atm protein , we disrupted the atm gene in mice through homologous recombination . initial evaluation of the atm knockout animals indicates that inactivation of the mouse atm gene recreates much of the phenotype of ataxia-telangiectasia . the homozygous mutant ( atm- / - ) mice are viable , growth-retarded , and infertile . the infertility of atm- / - mice results from meiotic failure . meiosis is arrested at the zygotene / pachytene stage of prophase i as a result of abnormal chromosomal synapsis and subsequent chromosome fragmentation . immune defects also are evident in atm- / - mice , including reduced numbers of b220 + cd43- pre-b cells , thymocytes , and peripheral t cells , as well as functional impairment of t-cell-dependent immune responses . the cerebella of atm- / - mice appear normal by histologic examination at 3 to 4 months and the mice have no gross behavioral abnormalities . the majority of mutant mice rapidly develop thymic lymphomas and die before 4 months of age . these findings indicate that the atm gene product plays an essential role in a diverse group of cellular processes , including meiosis , the normal growth of somatic tissues , immune development , and tumor suppression . .;0;0;1;1

the influence of the time interval between monoher and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice.;purpose: despite its well-known cardiotoxicity, the anthracyclin doxorubicin (dox) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent. dox-induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by dox. reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system. the semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoher) showed cardioprotection against dox-induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties. because of the relatively short final half-life of monoher (about 30 min), it is expected that the time interval between monoher and dox might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoher. therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect. methods: six groups of 6 balb/c mice were treated with saline, dox alone or dox (4 mg/kg i.v.) preceded by monoher (500 mg/kg i.p.) with an interval of 10, 30, 60 or 120 min. after a 6-week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks, the mice were sacrificed. their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy, after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to billingham (in cancer treat rep 62(6):865-872, 1978). microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with dox alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group (p<0.001). results: the number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold (95% ci 4.4-21.0) higher in mice treated with dox alone than that in animals of the control group. the ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with dox preceded by monoher and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 (mean 2.2, 95% ci 1.2-4.1, p=0.019). the mean protective effect by adding monoher before dox led to a significant 4.4-fold reduction (p<0.001, 95% ci 2.3-8.2) of abnormal cardiomyocytes. this protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoher and dox administration (p=0.345). conclusion: the results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoher may be administered shortly before dox.;1;0;0;1

cardiovascular alterations in rat fetuses exposed to calcium channel blockers.;preclinical toxicologic investigation suggested that a new calcium channel blocker, ro 40-5967, induced cardiovascular alterations in rat fetuses exposed to this agent during organogenesis. the present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers in general induce cardiovascular malformations indicating a pharmacologic class effect. we studied three calcium channel blockers of different structure, nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, along with the new agent. pregnant rats were administered one of these calcium channel blockers during the period of cardiac morphogenesis and the offspring examined on day 20 of gestation for cardiovascular malformations. a low incidence of cardiovascular malformations was observed after exposure to each of the four calcium channel blockers, but this incidence was statistically significant only for verapamil and nifedipine. all four agents were associated with aortic arch branching variants, although significantly increased only for ro 40-5967 and verapamil.;1;0;0;0
age of the intronic gaa triplet repeat expansion mutation in friedreich ataxia.;friedreich ataxia ( frda ) , the most frequently inherited ataxia , is due in the vast majority of cases to a large expansion of an intronic gaa repeat . using linkage disequilibrium analysis based on haplotype data of seven polymorphic markers close to the frataxin gene , the age of frda founding mutational event ( s ) is estimated to be at least 682 + / -203 generations ( 95 % confidence interval  564-801 g ) , a dating which is consistent with little or no negative selection and provides further evidence for an ancient spread of a pre-mutation ( at-risk alleles ) in western europe . .;0;0;1;0

detection of a novel missense mutation and second recurrent mutation in the cacna1a gene in individuals with ea-2 and fhm.;mutations in the brain specific p / q type ca2 + channel alpha1 subunit gene , cacna1a , have been identified in three clinically distinct disorders , viz . episodic ataxia type 2 ( ea-2 ) , familial hemiplegic migraine ( fhm ) and spinocerebellar ataxia 6 ( sca6 ) . for individuals with ea-2 , the mutations described thus far are presumed to result in a truncated protein product . several different missense mutations have been identified in patients with fhm . at least two of these mutations have been identified on two different chromosome 19p13 haplotypes and thus represent recurrent mutations . in the present study , we have screened several individuals for mutations in all 47 exons in the cacna1a gene by single-strand conformation analysis . we have characterised a novel missense mutation , g5260a , in exon 32 in a family segregating for ea-2 . the consequence of this mutation is an amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position within the cacna1a gene . this represents the first point mutation not resulting in a proposed truncated protein . furthermore , this mutation has been detected in a family member with mild clinical signs including only migraine . additionally , a second previously identified recurrent muta tion , c2272t , in exon 16 has been discovered in a patient with fhm . .;0;0;1;0
metformin protects against seizures, learning and memory impairments and oxidative damage induced by pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling in mice.;cognitive impairment, the most common and severe comorbidity of epilepsy, greatly diminishes the quality of life. however, current therapeutic interventions for epilepsy can also cause untoward cognitive effects. thus, there is an urgent need for new kinds of agents targeting both seizures and cognition deficits. oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in epileptogenesis and cognitive deficits, and antioxidants have a putative antiepileptic potential. metformin, the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic oral drug, has antioxidant properties. this study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of metformin on seizures, cognitive impairment and brain oxidative stress markers observed in pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling animals. male c57bl/6 mice were administered with subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole (37 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for 14 injections. metformin was injected intraperitoneally in dose of 200mg/kg along with alternate-day ptz. we found that metformin suppressed the progression of kindling, ameliorated the cognitive impairment and decreased brain oxidative stress. thus the present study concluded that metformin may be a potential agent for the treatment of epilepsy as well as a protective medicine against cognitive impairment induced by seizures.;0;0;1;0

effect of hibiscus rosa sinensis on reserpine-induced neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in rats.;effect of methanolic extract of hibiscus rosa sinensis (100-300 mg/kg) was studied on reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and neurochemical alterations. the rats were treated with intraperitoneal reserpine (1 mg/kg, ip) for 3 days every other day. on day 5, vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min. reserpine treated rats significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions however, coadministration of hibiscus rosa sinensis roots extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, per orally) attenuated the effects. biochemical analysis of brain revealed that the reserpine treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat) and glutathione reductase (gsh), an index of oxidative stress process. coadministration of extract significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and reversed the decrease in brain sod, cat and gsh levels. the results of the present study suggested that hibiscus rosa sinensis had a protective role against reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and oxidative stress.;0;0;1;0

ataxia-telangiectasia: identification and detection of founder-effect mutations in the atm gene in ethnic populations.;to facilitate the evaluation of atm heterozygotes for susceptibility to other diseases , such as breast cancer , we have attempted to define the most common mutations and their frequencies in ataxia-telangiectasia ( a-t ) homozygotes from 10 ethnic populations . both genomic mutations and their effects on cdna were characterized . protein-truncation testing of the entire atm cdna detected 92 ( 66 % ) truncating mutations in 140 mutant alleles screened . the haplotyping of patients with identical mutations indicates that almost all of these represent common ancestry and that very few spontaneously recurring atm mutations exist . assays requiring minimal amounts of genomic dna were designed to allow rapid screening for common ethnic mutations . these rapid assays detected mutations in 76 % of costa rican patients ( 3 ) , 50 % of norwegian patients ( 1 ) , 25 % of polish patients ( 4 ) , and 14 % of italian patients ( 1 ) , as well as in patients of amish / mennonite and irish english backgrounds . additional mutations were observed in japanese , utah mormon , and african american patients . these assays should facilitate screening for a-t heterozygotes in the populations studied . .;0;0;1;1

adrenoleukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy associated with partial adrenal insufficiency in three generations of a kindred.;four cases of adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) and one case of adrenomyeloneuropathy ( amn ) have developed in a kindred over three generations demonstrating that amn is a clinical variant of ald . pituitary-adrenal function studies were performed in 10 family members , including two affected males and four females identified as carriers of ald / amn . no pituitary-adrenal abnormality was found in the carriers . however , basal morning plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) levels were markedly elevated in the two males with ald and amn , despite the fact that they had no clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency and that morning plasma cortisol levels and their response to maximal exogenous acth stimulation appeared to be normal . in addition , the integrated 24-hour response to the administration were also subnormal in these two cases . thus , people with ald and amn may have subclinical partial adrenocrotical insufficiency . no other endocrinologic dysfunction was identified . .;0;1;1;0
protective effects of antithrombin on puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats.;we investigated the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors, in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis, which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syndrome. antithrombin (50 or 500 iu/kg/i.v.) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg/kg/i.v.). treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematological abnormalities. puromycin aminonucleoside-induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed. histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats, while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin-treated rats. in addition, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells. furthermore, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased. these findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome. treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome.;0;1;0;0

lpp, the preferred fusion partner gene of hmgic in lipomas, is a novel member of the lim protein gene family.;"a major cytogenetic subgroup of lipomas is characterized by recurrent chromosome aberrations , mainly translocations , that involve chromosome segment 12q13-q15 . multiple chromosomes have been found as the translocation partners of chromosome 12 but 3q27-q28 is preferentially involved . in previous studies , it has been shown that the high mobility group ( hmg ) protein gene hmgic at 12q15 is consistently rearranged as a consequence of these translocations . here , we report the identification and characterization of the chromosome 3-derived translocation partner gene , which we have designated lpp ( lipoma preferred partner gene ) . using 3-race analysis of hmgic fusion transcripts in lipoma cell line li-501 / sv40 , ectopic genetic sequences were obtained , which by cash ( chromosome assignment using somatic cell hybrids ) and fish ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) analysis were found to originate from chromosome segment 3q27-q28 . in northern blot analysis , an mrna of over 10 kb was detected by these ectopic sequences in a variety of human tissues but not in brain and peripheral blood leukocytes . upon partial cdna cloning , features of the genetic organization of lpp were established . the gene was found to span a genomic region of over 400 kb . nucleotide sequence analysis of a composite cdna of lpp revealed an open reading frame of 1836 nucleotides encoding a proline-rich protein containing a leucine-zipper motif in its amino-terminal region and three lim domains in its carboxy-terminal region . the lpp-encoded protein should be classified as a novel member of the group 3 proteins of the lim protein gene family . using reverse transcriptase combined with polymerase chain reactions in the analysis of a number of lipoma cell lines and primary lipomas , it appeared that lpp is frequently rearranged also in cases without a cytogenetically detectable involvement of 3q27-q28 . two alternative hmgic / lpp hybrid transcripts have been detected ; the difference between them is mainly the presence of either two or three lim domains in the predicted hmgi-c / lpp fusion proteins . .";0;0;1;0

ocular and auditory toxicity in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine.;during an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine (10-40 mg/kg bw/3 times weekly) for the first time were monitored for detection of audiovisual toxicity. 6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity. moreover, detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients. visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan-type dyschromatopsy, sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pigmentary retinal deposits. auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid- to high-frequency neurosensorial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear type. desferrioxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3, and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3. this toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of desferrioxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum levels. the data indicate that audiovisual toxicity is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine. periodical audiovisual monitoring should be performed on hemodialyzed patients receiving the drug in order to detect adverse effects as early as possible.;0;0;1;0

a phase i clinical study of the antipurine antifolate lometrexol (ddathf) given with oral folic acid.;lometrexol is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (garft), an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis. extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate. however, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities. preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. this observation prompted a phase i clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation. thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities. there was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation. associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance. the work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a garft inhibitor. this information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in cancer therapy.;0;0;0;1

atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat.;to assess the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin (atorva) on dexamethasone (dex)-induced hypertension, 60 male sprague-dawley rats were treated with atorva 30 mg/kg/day or tap water for 15 days. dex increased systolic blood pressure (sbp) from 109 +/- 1.8 to 135 +/- 0.6 mmhg and plasma superoxide (5711 +/- 284.9 saline, 7931 +/- 392.8 u/ml dex, p < 0.001). in this prevention study, sbp in the atorva + dex group was increased from 115 +/- 0.4 to 124 +/- 1.5 mmhg, but this was significantly lower than in the dex-only group (p' < 0.05). atorva reversed dex-induced hypertension (129 +/- 0.6 mmhg, vs. 135 +/- 0.6 mmhg p' < 0.05) and decreased plasma superoxide (7931 +/- 392.8 dex, 1187 +/- 441.2 atorva + dex, p < 0.0001). plasma nitrate/nitrite (nox) was decreased in dex-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats (11.2 +/- 1.08 microm, 15.3 +/- 1.17 microm, respectively, p < 0.05). atorva affected neither plasma nox nor thymus weight. thus, atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat.;1;0;0;0

a transient neurological deficit following intrathecal injection of 1% hyperbaric bupivacaine for unilateral spinal anaesthesia.;we describe a case of transient neurological deficit that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1% hyperbaric bupivacaine slowly injected through a 25-gauge pencil-point spinal needle. the surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful, but 3 days after surgery, the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over l3-l4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on (loss of pinprick sensation) without reduction in muscular strength. sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks. prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow-up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect. however, we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution (if pencil-point needle and slow injection rate are employed), in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration, which might lead to a transient neurological deficit.;0;0;1;0

amiodarone-related pulmonary mass and unique membranous glomerulonephritis in a patient with valvular heart disease: diagnostic pitfall and new findings.;amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug for life-threatening tachycardia, but various adverse effects have been reported. reported herein is an autopsy case of valvular heart disease, in a patient who developed a lung mass (1.5 cm in diameter) and proteinuria (2.76 g/day) after treatment with amiodarone for a long time. the lung mass was highly suspected to be lung cancer on ct and positron emission tomography, but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies, indicating that it was an amiodarone-related lesion. in addition, the lung tissue had unevenly distributed hemosiderin deposition, and abnormally tortuous capillaries were seen in the mass and in heavily hemosiderotic lung portions outside the mass. in the kidneys, glomeruli had membrane spikes, prominent swelling of podocytes and subepithelial deposits, which were sometimes large and hump-like. autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, malignant neoplasms or other diseases with a known relationship to membranous glomerulonephritis were not found. the present case highlights the possibility that differential diagnosis between an amiodarone-related pulmonary lesion and a neoplasm can be very difficult radiologically, and suggests that membranous glomerulonephritis might be another possible complication of amiodarone treatment.;1;1;1;1

cholestatic jaundice associated with the use of metformin.;we report a patient who developed cholestatic jaundice shortly after initiation of treatment with metformin hydrochloride. ultrasound of the liver and abdominal ct were normal. an ercp showed normal biliary anatomy. a percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked cholestasis, with portal edema, ductular proliferation, and acute inflammation. metformin hydrochloride was discontinued, and the patient's jaundice resolved slowly over a period of several months. given the onset of his jaundice 2 wk after the initiation of metformin, we believe that this case represents an example of metformin-associated hepatotoxicity, the first such case reported.;0;1;0;0
neuroleptic malignant syndrome with risperidone.;neuroleptic malignant syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine d2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia. risperidone, a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic, has high serotonin 5-ht2 receptor blockade and dose-related d2 receptor blockade. the high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dosages. with this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms, it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be lowered. a 73-year-old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone. the syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine. it appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome.;0;0;1;0

therapeutic drug monitoring of tobramycin: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules.;objective: to evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of tobramicyn on steady-state serum concentrations and toxicity. materials and methods: patients undergoing treatment with i.v. tobramycin (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups. group od (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of tobramycin and group td (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. tobramycin serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. the renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before, during and immediately after treatment. results: the two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, body weight and renal function. no statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose, duration of treatment, or cumulative dose. trough concentrations were < 2 g/ml in the two groups (100%). peak concentrations were > 6 microg/ml in 100% of the od group and in 67% of the td group (p< 0.01). mean peak concentrations were markedly different: 11.00+/-2.89 microg/ml in od vs. 6.53+/-1.45 microg/ml in td (p< 0.01). the pharmacokinetics parameters were: ke, (0.15+/-0.03/h in od vs. 0.24+/-0.06/h in td), t1/2, (4.95+/-1.41 h in od vs. 3.07+/-0.71 h in td), vd (0.35+/-0.11 l/kg in od vs. 0.33+/-0.09 l/kg in td), cl (0.86+/-0.29 ml/min/kg in od vs. 1.28+/-0.33 ml/min/kg in td). increased serum creatinine was observed in 73% of patients in od versus 57% of patients in td, without evidence of nephrotoxicity. in td group, three patients developed decreased auditory function, of which one presented with an auditory loss of -30 db, whereas in the od group only one patient presented decreased auditory function. conclusion: this small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of tobramycin is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen. using a single-dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg/ml.;0;1;0;0

an evaluation of genetic heterogeneity in 145 breast-ovarian cancer families.;breast cancer linkage consortium. the breast-ovary cancer-family syndrome is a dominant predisposition to cancer of the breast and ovaries which has been mapped to chromosome region 17q12-q21 . the majority , but not all , of breast-ovary cancer families show linkage to this susceptibility locus , designated brca1 . we report here the results of a linkage analysis of 145 families with both breast and ovarian cancer . these families contain either a total of three or more cases of early-onset ( before age 60 years ) breast cancer or ovarian cancer . all families contained at least one case of ovarian cancer . overall , an estimated 76 % of the 145 families are linked to the brca1 locus . none of the 13 families with cases of male breast cancer appear to be linked , but it is estimated that 92 % ( 95 % confidence interval 76 % -100 % ) of families with no male breast cancer and with two or more ovarian cancers are linked to brca1 . these data suggest that the breast-ovarian cancer-family syndrome is genetically heterogeneous . however , the large majority of families with early-onset breast cancer and with two or more cases of ovarian cancer are likely to be due to brca1 mutations . .;0;0;0;1
genetic mapping of the copper toxicosis locus in bedlington terriers to dog chromosome 10, in a region syntenic to human chromosome region 2p13-p16.;abnormal hepatic copper accumulation is recognized as an inherited disorder in man , mouse , rat and dog . the major cause of hepatic copper accumulation in man is a dysfunctional atp7b gene , causing wilson disease ( wd ) . mutations in the atp7b genes have also been demonstrated in mouse and rat . the atp7b gene has been excluded in the much rarer human copper overload disease non-indian childhood cirrhosis , indicating genetic heterogeneity . by investigating the common autosomal recessive copper toxicosis ( ct ) in bedlington terriers , we have identified a new locus involved in progressive liver disease . we examined whether the wd gene atp7b was also causative for ct by investigating the chromosomal co-localization of atp7b and c04107 , using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) . c04107 is an anonymous microsatellite marker closely linked to ct . however , bac clones containing atp7b and c04107 mapped to the canine chromosome regions cfa22q11 and cfa10q26 , respectively , demonstrating that wd cannot be homologous to ct . the copper transport genes ctr1 and ctr2 were also excluded as candidate genes for ct since they both mapped to canine chromosome region cfa11q22 . 2-22 . 5 . a transcribed sequence identified from the c04107-containing bac was found to be homologous to a gene expressed from human chromosome 2p13-p16 , a region devoid of any positional candidate genes .;0;1;0;0

urine n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase--a marker of tubular damage?;background: although an indicator of renal tubular dysfunction, an increased urinary n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nag) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells. methods: puromycin aminonucleoside (pan) was administered to sprague dawley rats to induce proteinuria. total protein, albumin, nag activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days. the morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three, four, six, eight and thirty three and the nag isoenzyme patterns on days zero, four, eight and thirty three. results: following intravenous pan urine volume and urine nag activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four. after day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin, total protein excretion and nag activity. electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards. protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four. peak urine nag activity and a change in nag isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and nag droplets (day six onwards). conclusions: this animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine nag activity, occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells. urine nag activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage.;0;1;0;0

less frequent lithium administration and lower urine volume.;objective: this study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of lithium on a once-per-day schedule have lower urine volumes than do patients receiving multiple doses per day. method: this was a cross-sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose schedules. patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level, creatinine clearance, urine volume, and maximum osmolality. results: multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes. the dosing schedule, duration of lithium treatment, and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance. conclusions: urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and/or by lowering the total daily dose. lithium-induced polyuria seems to be related to extrarenal as well as to renal effects.;0;1;1;0

effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the course of adriamycin-induced nephropathy.;the effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (cei) enalapril was assessed in munich-wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis. rats were given a single dose of adriamycin and one month later divided into four groups matched for albuminuria, blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentration. groups 1 and 3 remained untreated while groups 2 and 4 received enalapril. groups 1 and 2 underwent micropuncture studies after 10 days. these short-term studies showed that enalapril reduced arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm hg, group 2 vs. 1, p less than 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm hg, p less than 0.05) without reducing albuminuria (617 +/- 50 vs. 570 +/- 47 mg/day) or gfr (1.03 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.11 ml/min). groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of enalapril on progression of renal injury in adriamycin nephrosis. chronic enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing albuminuria in group 4. untreated group 3 rats exhibited a progressive reduction in gfr (0.35 +/- 0.08 ml/min at 4 months, 0.27 +/- 0.07 ml/min at 6 months). enalapril treatment blunted but did not prevent reduction in gfr in group 4 (0.86 +/- 0.15 ml/min at 4 months, 0.69 +/- 0.13 ml/min at 6 months, both p less than 0.05 vs. group 3). reduction in gfr was associated with the development of glomerular sclerosis in both treated and untreated rats.(abstract truncated at 250 words);1;1;0;0
high resolution genetic analysis suggests one ancestral predisposing haplotype for the origin of the myotonic dystrophy mutation.;the mutation causing myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) has been identified as an amplification of an unstable trinucleotide ( ctg ) n repeat in over 99 % of the global dm population . it is in complete linkage disequilibrium with an alu element polymorphism within the dm kinase gene , suggesting that dm is a consequence of one or few ancestral mutations . a recent analysis utilizing this polymorphism as well as a flanking dinucleotide marker , suggested that similar to fragile x syndrome , dm exhibited a founder effect ( imbert et al . , 1993 nature genet . 4 , 72-76 ) . in contrast , the low reproductive fitness of individuals with congenital dm ( the endpoint of genetic anticipation in myotonic dystrophy ) suggests a higher rate of new mutations . we present a high resolution genetic analysis of the dm locus using pcr based assays of nine polymorphisms , spanning a physical distance of 30 kb , within and immediately flanking the dm kinase gene . the persistent complete allelic association of the dm mutation with all these polymorphisms provides further support to previous observations and suggests more strongly that the dm mutation occurred on the background of a particular haplotype in which the ( ctg ) n repeat became inherently unstable and therefore predisposed to amplification .;0;0;1;0
myotonic dystrophy: the role of the cug triplet repeats in splicing of a novel dmpk exon and altered cytoplasmic dmpk mrna isoform ratios.;the mechanism by which ( ctg ) n expansion in the 3 utr of the dmpk gene causes myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) is unknown . we identified four rna splicing factors--hnrnp c , u2af ( u2 auxiliary factor ) , ptb ( polypyrimidine tract binding protein ) , and psf ( ptb associated splicing factor ) --that bind to two short regions 3 of the ( cug ) n , and found a novel 3 dmpk exon resulting in an mrna lacking the repeats . we propose that the ( cug ) n is an essential cis acting element for this splicing event . in contrast to ( cug ) n containing mrnas , the novel isoform is not retained in the nucleus in dm cells , resulting in imbalances in relative levels of cytoplasmic dmpk mrna isoforms and a new dominant effect of the mutation on dmpk . .;0;0;1;0
attenuation of methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice by lipopolysaccharide pretreatment.;immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic terminal damage. in this study, we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide, a pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factor, treatment in modulating the methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity. lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine-elicited hyperthermia three days later. such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose-dependent manner. as the most potent dose (1 mg/kg) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks, one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen, methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered. moreover, systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment (1 mg/kg) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion-produced dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum, indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine. we concluded a critical time window for systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment in exerting effective protection against methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity.;0;0;1;0
death from chemotherapy in gestational trophoblastic disease.;"multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high-risk stage of choriocarcinoma. based on this principle a 27-year old woman, classified as being in the high-risk group (goldstein and berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs. the multiple drug schema consisted of: etoposide 16.213, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, actomycin-d, and cisplatin. on the first day of the schedule, moderate high doses of methotrexate, etoposide and cyclophosphamide were administered. within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus. formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli. in view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, must be considered less likely. patients with large pelvic tumor loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance. notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment, especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug. close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta-hcg values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started.(abstract truncated at 250 words)";0;0;0;1

age and renal clearance of cimetidine.;in 35 patients (ages 20 to 86 yr) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by high-pressure liquid chromatography and for creatinine. cimetidine clearance decreased with age. the extrapolated 6-hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose, after intravenous cimetidine, increased with age of the patients. the ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance (rc) averaged 4.8 +/- 2.0, indicating net tubular secretion for cimetidine. rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine, suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process. there was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1.25 microgram/ml. thus, high cimetidine levels alone do not always induce dementia.;0;1;1;0

the mapping of a cdna from the human x-linked duchenne muscular dystrophy gene to the mouse x chromosome.;"the recent discovery of sequences at the site of the duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) gene in humans has opened up the possibility of a detailed molecular analysis of the genes in humans and in related mammalian species . until relatively recently , there was no obvious mouse model of this genetic disease for the development of therapeutic strategies . the identification of a mouse x-linked mutant showing muscular dystrophy , mdx , has provided a candidate mouse genetic homologue to the dmd locus ; the relatively mild pathological features of mdx suggest it may have more in common with mutations of the becker muscular dystrophy type at the same human locus , however . but the close genetic linkage of mdx to g6pd and hprt on the mouse x chromosome , coupled with its comparatively mild pathology , have suggested that the mdx mutation may instead correspond to emery dreifuss muscular dystrophy which itself is closely linked to dna markers at xq28-qter in the region of g6pd on the human x chromosome . using an interspecific mouse domesticus / spretus cross , segregating for a variety of markers on the mouse x chromosome , we have positioned on the mouse x chromosome sequences homologous to a dmd cdna clone . these sequences map provocatively close to the mdx mutation and unexpectedly distant from sparse fur , spf , the mouse homologue of otc ( ornithine transcarbamylase ) which is closely linked to dmd on the human x chromosome . .";0;0;1;0

reduced sodium channel density, altered voltage dependence of inactivation, and increased susceptibility to seizures in mice lacking sodium channel beta 2-subunits.;sodium channel beta-subunits modulate channel gating, assembly, and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems. we generated beta2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of sodium channel density, localization, and function in neurons in vivo. measurements of [(3)h]saxitoxin (stx) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane sodium channels in beta2(-/-) neurons. the loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. the integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium channels. in contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of na(v)1.6 channels in the nodes of ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures, as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures, but seemed normal in other neurological tests. our observations show that beta2-subunits play an important role in the regulation of sodium channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability.;0;0;1;0

influence of smoking on developing cochlea. does smoking during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns?;objective: maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth. the influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults. the objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (teoaes) of healthy neonates. methods: this study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns. newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers. exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36). results: in exposed neonates, teoaes mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates. comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences. however, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant decreases of teoaes amplitudes at 4000hz for all three groups. mean teoaes responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group. conclusion: in utero, exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells. these effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure. further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate's hearing acuity.;0;0;1;0

a transgene insertion creating a heritable chromosome deletion mouse model of prader-willi and angelman syndromes.;prader-willi syndrome ( pws ) and angelman syndrome ( as ) result from the loss of function of imprinted genes in human chromosome 15q11-q13 . the central part of mouse chromosome 7 is homologous to human 15q11-q13 , with conservation of both gene order and imprinted features . we report here the characterization of a transgene insertion ( epstein-barr virus latent membrane protein 2a , lmp2a ) into mouse chromosome 7c , which has resulted in mouse models for pws and as dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent . epigenotype ( allelic expression and dna methylation ) and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses indicate that the transgene-induced mutation has generated a complete deletion of the pws / as-homologous region but has not deleted flanking loci . because the intact chromosome 7 , opposite the deleted homolog , maintains the correct imprint in somatic cells of pws and as mice and establishes the correct imprint in male and female germ cells of as mice , homologous association and replication asynchrony are not part of the imprinting mechanism . this heritable-deletion mouse model will be particularly useful for the identification of the etiological genes and mechanisms , phenotypic basis , and investigation of therapeutic approaches for pws . .;0;0;1;0

cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity: an analysis of dosing as a risk factor.;"patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation are generally immunosuppressed with a dose of cyclophosphamide (cya) which is usually calculated based on the patient's weight. at these high doses of cya, serious cardiotoxicity may occur, but definitive risk factors for the development of such cardiotoxicity have not been described. since chemotherapeutic agent toxicity generally correlates with dose per body surface area, we retrospectively calculated the dose of cya in patients transplanted at our institution to determine whether the incidence of cya cardiotoxicity correlated with the dose per body surface area. eighty patients who were to receive cya 50 mg/kg/d for four days as preparation for marrow grafting underwent a total of 84 transplants for aplastic anemia, wiskott-aldrich syndrome, or severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. fourteen of 84 (17%) patients had symptoms and signs consistent with cya cardiotoxicity within ten days of receiving 1 to 4 doses of cya. six of the 14 patients died with congestive heart failure. the dose of cya per body surface area was calculated for all patients and the patients were divided into two groups based on daily cya dose: group 1, cya less than or equal to 1.55 g/m2/d; group 2, cya greater than 1.55 g/m2/d. cardiotoxicity that was thought to be related to cya occurred in 1/32 (3%) of patients in group 1 and in 13/52 (25%) patients in group 2 (p less than 0.025). congestive heart failure caused or contributed to death in 0/32 patients in group 1 v 6/52 (12%) of patients in group 2 (p less than 0.25). there was no difference in the rate of engraftment of evaluable patients in the two groups (p greater than 0.5). we conclude that the cya cardiotoxicity correlates with cya dosage as calculated by body surface area, and that patients with aplastic anemia and immunodeficiencies can be effectively prepared for bone marrow grafting at a cya dose of 1.55 g/m2/d for four days with a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity than patients whose cya dosage is calculated based on weight. this study reaffirms the principle that drug toxicity correlates with dose per body surface area.";1;0;1;0
midline b3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa.;previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the b3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord. the present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the b3 serotonin neurons in the medulla, coinciding with the raphe magnus. in spontaneously hypertensive, stroke-prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline b3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30-40 mm hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-dht) injected intracerebroventricularly. however, intraspinal injection of 5,7-dht to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension. further, 5,7-dht lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the b3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline b3 serotonin methyldopa injection. it is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral b3 cells which mediate a methyldopa-induced hypotension via descending projections, the midline serotonin b3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.;1;0;1;0

acute insulin treatment normalizes the resistance to the cardiotoxic effect of isoproterenol in streptozotocin diabetic rats. a morphometric study of isoproterenol induced myocardial fibrosis.;the acute effect of insulin treatment on the earlier reported protective effect of streptozotocin diabetes against the cardiotoxic effect of high doses of isoproterenol (iso) was investigated in rats. thirty to 135 min after the injection of crystalline insulin, iso was given subcutaneously and when iso induced fibrosis in the myocardium was morphometrically analyzed 7 days later, a highly significant correlation (r = 0.83, 2 p = 0.006) to the slope of the fall in blood glucose after insulin treatment appeared. the myocardial content of catecholamines was estimated in these 8 day diabetic rats. the norepinephrine content was significantly increased while epinephrine remained unchanged. an enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity with a consequent down regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors could, therefore, explain this catecholamine resistance. the rapid reversion after insulin treatment excludes the possibility that streptozotocin in itself causes the iso resistance and points towards a direct insulin effect on myocardial catecholamine sensitivity in diabetic rats. the phenomenon described might elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms behind toxic myocardial cell degeneration and may possibly have relevance for acute cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients.;1;0;1;0
the human complement c9 gene: identification of two mutations causing deficiency and revision of the gene structure.;the ninth component of human complement ( c9 ) is the last of the terminal complement components creating the membrane attack complex . c9 is a single-chain serum protein that is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 5p . deficiency of terminal complement components is generally associated with recurrent neisseria infections . we studied a previously described swiss family with inherited c9 deficiency . to identify the genetic basis of c9 deficiency , we developed an approach using exon-specific pcr and direct dna sequencing . as a cause of c9 deficiency , we found two different point mutations , both generating tga stop codons in the coding sequence . one mutation , a c to a exchange , was detected in exon 2 at cdna position 166 , the other , a c to t exchange , was located in exon 4 ( cdna position 464 ) . in family studies of three first-degree relatives with heterozygous c9 deficiency , we demonstrated that the two mutations are segregating independently . therefore , these mutations are sufficient to explain the complete deficiency of both the probands studied . dna sequencing of the exon-intron junctions revealed a number of revisions regarding the boundaries between exons 4 , 5 , and 6 as well as between exons 10 and 11 . no additional introns were detected in exons 6 and 10 . furthermore , dna marker studies were conducted using known polymorphisms of the c6 , c7 , and c9 genes , confirming the linkage of the observed c9 mutations with defined haplotypes . .;0;0;1;0

optimization of levodopa therapy.;"while there is no single correct starting dose for levodopa therapy, many individuals can be started on either the 25/100 or controlled-release formula, following the general rule not to attempt to titrate carbidopa-levodopa to the point of ""normality,"" which can lead to toxicity. the physician should also determine the proper use of any adjunctive medications; such combined therapy has become the standard approach to treatment. following the initial period of therapy, emerging difficulties require a reassessment of therapeutic approaches, such as dosage adjustment or introduction of a dopamine agonist. other possible adverse effects--such as gastrointestinal disorders, orthostatic hypotension, levodopa-induced psychosis, sleep disturbances or parasomnias, or drug interactions--also require carefully monitored individual treatment. nonpharmacologic concerns can help the parkinson's disease patient achieve and maintain optimal functioning, including daily exercise, physical therapy, and involvement with support groups.";0;0;1;0

changes of sodium and atp affinities of the cardiac (na,k)-atpase during and after nitric oxide deficient hypertension.;in the cardiovascular system, no is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions. inhibition of no synthesis induces sustained hypertension. in several models of hypertension, elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue. to assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of na+, we studied the response of cardiac (na,k)-atpase to no-deficient hypertension induced in rats by no-synthase inhibition with 40 mg/kg/day n(g)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name) for 4 four weeks. after 4-week administration of l-name, the systolic blood pressure (sbp) increased by 36%. two weeks after terminating the treatment, the sbp recovered to control value. when activating the (na,k)-atpase with its substrate atp, no changes in km and vmax values were observed in no-deficient rats. during activation with na+, the vmax remained unchanged, however the k(na) increased by 50%, indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the na+-binding site in no-deficient rats. after recovery from hypertension, the activity of (na,k)-atpase increased, due to higher affinity of the atp-binding site, as revealed from the lowered km value for atp. the k(na) value for na+ returned to control value. inhibition of no-synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed na+-extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated na+-binding properties of the (na,k)-atpase. after recovery of blood pressure to control values, the extrusion of na+ from cardiac cells was normalized, as revealed by restoration of the (na,k)-atpase activity.;1;0;0;0

plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of nephrotic syndrome induced in the rat by puromycin aminonucleoside.;this study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were due to nephrotic syndrome per se, or, at least in part, to the aminonucleoside. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (20 mg/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of nephrotic syndrome. since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-nephrotic stage (day 1-5) and nephrotic stage (day 6-11). in pre-nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty acids, triacylglycerol and vldl decreased while that of phospholipid, cholesteryl esters and hdl remained constant. plasma apolipoprotein a-i tended to increase (40% increase at day 5). at the beginning of nephrotic stage (day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein a-i increased abruptly (4-fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days. the plasma concentration of hdl followed the same pattern. plasma vldl and ldl increased at a later stage (day 9). plasma apolipoprotein a-i was found not only in hdl (1.063-1.210 g/ml) but also in the ldl density class (1.025-1.050 g/ml). in the pre-nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of hdl. these observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering vldl and increasing hdl. it is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma hdl found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on hdl metabolism.;0;1;0;0

iatrogenic risks of endometrial carcinoma after treatment for breast cancer in a large french case-control study. f  d  ration nationale des centres de lutte contre le cancer (fnclcc).;since tamoxifen is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer, its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined. we have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case-control study. cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). after adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). women who had endometrial cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment. our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial cancer, particularly when used as currently proposed for breast cancer prevention. pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with breast cancer. endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prognosis. women who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment. a long-term evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of tamoxifen as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted.;0;0;0;1
effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.;platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) with prominent anti-inflammatory properties. their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate. patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen, 100 mg, three times a day (ketoprofen group, n = 9) or a weak nsaid, acetaminophen, 1 g, three times a day (acetaminophen group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal sah. treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively. test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first, third, and fifth postoperative mornings. maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microm of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen. aggregation was lower (p < .05) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day. in contrast, maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results (p < .05). one patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma. coagulation (prothrombin time [pt], activated partial thromboplastin time [appt], fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin iii [at iii]) was comparable between the two groups. ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with sah. if ketoprofen is used before surgery on cerebral artery aneurysms, it may pose an additional risk factor for hemorrhage.;1;0;1;0

yeast artificial chromosomes for the molecular analysis of the familial polyposis apc gene region.;two yeast artificial chromosomes ( yacs ) spanning a total distance of 1 . 1 megabase pairs of dna around the mcc ( for mutated in colorectal carcinoma ) and apc ( for adenomatous polyposis coli ) genes at 5q21 have been isolated and characterized . starting from the mcc gene , a strategy was undertaken to identify constitutional submicroscopic deletions in familial adenomatous polyposis patients that might considerably narrow down the position of the apc gene . to this end , yacs identified by the mcc gene were screened across a chromosome 5-specific cosmid library to provide a source of dna probes for genomic scanning . the cosmids isolated from these experiments were used to screen a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing chromosome 5 segregated from patients suspected to carry putative interstitial deletions . this screening approach led to the confirmation of a small heterozygous deletion in a polyposis patient that overlaps one of the two isolated yacs . this yac has been shown to contain the entire apc gene , in addition to a significant portion of dna flanking the 5 end of the gene , and should therefore prove a valuable resource for functional studies by transfer to colorectal tumor-derived cell lines .;0;0;0;1

effect of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors on experimentally induced convulsions in rats.;"to investigate the relationship of prostaglandins (pgs) to seizure induction, the effects of six pg synthetase inhibitors on convulsions induced by flurothyl, picrotoxin, pentetrazol (ptz), electroshock or bicuculline were evaluated. ibuprofen, sulindac, mefenamic acid, and low dose meclofenamic acid increased the latency-to-onset in the flurothyl and/or ptz models; the electroshock, picrotoxin and bicuculline models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents. these results suggest that pgs are involved in the mechanism(s) underlying fluorthyl- and ptz-induced convulsions, but not picrotoxin-, electroshock-, or bicuculline-induced convulsions.";0;0;1;0

antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of the presynaptic cholinergic amplifier pg-9.;"the antinociceptive effect of 3 alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate [(+/-)-pg-9] (10-40 mg kg-1 s.c.; 30-60 mg kg-1 p.o.; 10-30 mg kg-1 i.v.; 10-30 micrograms/mouse i.c.v.) was examined in mice, rats and guinea pigs by use of the hot-plate, abdominal-constriction, tail-flick and paw-pressure tests. (+/-)-pg-9 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished. the antinociception produced by (+/-)-pg-9 was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist atropine, the m1-selective antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine and the acetylcholine depletor hemicholinium-3, but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone, the gamma-aminobutyric acidb antagonist 3-aminopropyl-diethoxy-methyl-phosphinic acid, the h3 agonist r-(alpha)-methylhistamine, the d2 antagonist quinpirole, the 5-hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chlorobenzoic acid 2-(diethylamino)ethyl ester hydrochloride, the 5-hydroxytryptamin1a antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor reserpine. based on these data, it can be postulated that (+/-)-pg-9 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission. (+/-)-pg-9 (10-40 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine (1 mg kg-1 i.p.) and dicyclomine (2 mg kg-1 i.p.) in the mouse passive-avoidance test. affinity profiles of (+/-)-pg-9 for muscarinic receptor subtypes, determined by functional studies (rabbit vas deferens for m1, guinea pig atrium for m2, guinea pig ileum for m3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative m4), have shown an m4/m1 selectivity ratio of 10.2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti-amnesic effect induced by (+/-)-pg-9 through an increase in acetylcholine extracellular levels. in the antinociceptive and antiamnesic dose range, (+/-)-pg-9 did not impair mouse performance evaluated by the rota-rod test and animex apparatus.";0;0;1;0

"calcium carbonate toxicity: the updated milk-alkali syndrome; report of 3 cases and review of the literature.";objective: to describe 3 patients with calcium carbonate-induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk-alkali syndrome. methods: we report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg/dl) and review the pertinent literature on milk-alkali syndrome. results: the 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency, relative metabolic alkalosis, and low parathyroid hormone (pth), pth-related peptide, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d concentrations. no malignant lesion was found. treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide. the 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously (60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe hypocalcemia. of the 3 patients, 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental calcium (1 g and 2 g daily, respectively) in the form of calcium carbonate. in addition to our highlighted cases, we review the history, classification, pathophysiologic features, and treatment of milk-alkali syndrome and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to november 2003. conclusion: milk-alkali syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons. treatment with hydration, furosemide, and discontinuation of the calcium and vitamin d source is adequate. pamidronate treatment is associated with considerable risk for hypocalcemia, even in cases of initially severe hypercalcemia.;0;1;0;0
the murine homolog of the human breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca1 maps to mouse chromosome 11d.;the recently cloned human breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene , brca1 , is located on human chromosome 17q21 . we have isolated murine genomic clones containing brca1 as a first step in generating a mouse model for the loss of brca1 function . a mouse genomic library was screened using probes corresponding to exon 11 of the human brca1 gene . two overlapping mouse clones were identified that hybridized to human brca1 exons 9-12 . sequence analysis of 1 . 4 kb of the region of these clones corresponding to part of human exon 11 revealed 72 % nucleic acid identity but only 50 % amino acid identity with the human gene . the longest of the mouse brca1 genomic clones maps to chromosome 11d , as determined by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization . the synteny to human chromosome 17 was confirmed by cohybridization with the mouse probe for the nf1-gene . this comparative study confirms that the relative location of the brca1 gene has been conserved between mice and humans .;0;0;1;1

ethambutol-associated optic neuropathy.;introduction: ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which is still prevalent in southeast asia, and can be associated with permanent visual loss. we report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia. clinical picture: three patients with ethambutol-associated toxic optic neuropathy are described. all 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity, colour vision (ishihara) and visual field. the visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour, suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm. treatment: despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months. subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases. in the third case, visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale. outcome: all 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function. conclusions: ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up. the author postulates that in cases of ethambutol associated chiasmopathy, ethambutol may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm.;0;0;1;0
pallidal stimulation: an alternative to pallidotomy?;"a resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of parkinson's disease (pd) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by laitinen in 1985. laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant pd, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community. another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long-term success rates and low morbidity rates. pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success. according to the literature pallidotomy improves the ""on"" symptoms of pd, such as dyskinesias, as well as the ""off"" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on-off fluctuations. pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving levodopa-induced dyskinesias. stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper- or dyskinetic upper limbs, but increases the ""freezing"" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time. considering the small increase in the patient's independence, the high costs of bilateral implants, and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices, the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy.";0;0;1;0
development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in parkinsonian monkeys may depend upon rate of symptom onset and/or duration of symptoms.;levodopa-induced dyskinesias (lids) present a major problem for the long-term management of parkinson's disease (pd) patients. due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations, it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of lids. using macaque monkeys with different types of mptp-induced parkinsonism, the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of levodopa therapy may be involved in the development of lids. monkeys with acute (short-term) mptp exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy developed dyskinesia between 11 and 24 days of daily levodopa administration. in contrast, monkeys with long-term mptp exposure, slow symptom progression and/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy were more resistant to developing lids (e.g., dyskinesia developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic levodopa administration). all animals were similarly symptomatic at the start of levodopa treatment and had similar therapeutic responses to the drug. these data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop lids in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to levodopa and demonstrate the value of these models for further studying the pathophysiology of lids.;0;0;1;0

influence of diet free of nad-precursors on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mice.;"recently, we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of nicotinic acid amide, a selective inhibitor of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp; ec 2.4.2.30) on mice suffering from acetaminophen (aap)-hepatitis, suggesting that the aap-induced liver injury involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation. the present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of nad, the substrate on which parp acts, in female nmri mice with aap hepatitis and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals. liver injuries were quantified as serum activities of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (got) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (gpt). while aap caused a 117-fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet, which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by nicotinic acid amide (naa), adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of nad. in these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of aap, and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a standard diet, the liver damage was inhibited by 50% by ethanol. a further 64% reduction of hepatitis was observed, when naa was given to ethanol/aap-mice. our results provide evidence that the aap-induced hepatitis and its exacerbation by ethanol can either be reduced by end-product inhibition of parp by naa or by dietary depletion of the enzyme's substrate nad. we see the main application of naa as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of acetaminophen in order to avoid hepatic damage in patients treated with this widely used analgesic.";0;1;0;0

effect of doxorubicin on [omega-i-131]heptadecanoic acid myocardial scintigraphy and echocardiography in dogs.;the effects of serial treatment with doxorubicin on dynamic myocardial scintigraphy with [omega-i-131]heptadecanoic acid (i-131 ha), and on global left-ventricular function determined echocardiographically, were studied in a group of nine mongrel dogs. total extractable myocardial lipid was compared postmortem between a group of control dogs and doxorubicin-treated dogs. a significant and then progressive fall in global lv function was observed at a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 4 mg/kg. a significant increase in the myocardial t1/2 of the i-131 ha was observed only at a higher cumulative dose, 10 mg/kg. no significant alteration in total extractable myocardial lipids was observed between control dogs and those treated with doxorubicin. our findings suggest that the changes leading to an alteration of myocardial dynamic imaging with i-131 ha are not the initiating factor in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.;1;0;0;0

procainamide-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia.;seven cases of procainamide-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia are presented. in four patients, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of procainamide for the treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia. in the remaining three patients, procainamide was administered orally for treatment of chronic premature ventricular contractions or atrial flutter. these patients had q-t prolongation and recurrent syncope due to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. in four patients, the arrhythmia was rapidly diagnosed and treated with disappearance of further episodes of the arrhythmia. in two patients, the arrhythmia degenerated into irreversible ventricular fibrillation and both patients died. in the seventh patient, a permanent ventricular pacemaker was inserted and, despite continuation of procainamide therapy, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia did not reoccur. these seven cases demonstrate that procainamide can produce an acquired prolonged q-t syndrome with polymorphous ventricular tachycardia.;1;0;0;0
somatic instability of the ctg repeat in mice transgenic for the myotonic dystrophy region is age dependent but not correlated to the relative intertissue transcription levels and proliferative capacities.;a ( ctg ) nexpansion in the 3-untranslated region ( utr ) of the dm protein kinase gene ( dmpk ) is responsible for causing myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) . major instability , with very large expansions between generations and high levels of somatic mosaicism , is observed in patients . there is a good correlation between repeat size ( at least in leucocytes ) , clinical severity and age of onset . the trinucleotide repeat instability mechanisms involved in dm and other human genetic diseases are unknown . we studied somatic instability by measuring the ctg repeat length at several ages in various tissues of transgenic mice carrying a ( ctg ) 55expansion surrounded by 45 kb of the human dm region , using small-pool pcr . these mice have been shown to reproduce the intergenerational and somatic instability of the 55 ctg repeat suggesting that surrounding sequences and the chromatin environment are involved in instability mechanisms . as observed in some of the tissues of dm patients , there is a tendency for repeat length and somatic mosaicism to increase with the age of the mouse . furthermore , we observed no correlation between the somatic mutation rate and tissue proliferation capacity . the somatic mutation rates in different tissues were also not correlated to the relative inter-tissue difference in transcriptional levels of the three genes ( dmahp , dmpk and 59 ) surrounding the repeat . .;0;0;1;0

evaluation of adverse reactions of aponidine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution.;we prospectively evaluated the adverse reactions of apraclonidine in 20 normal volunteers by instilling a single drop of 1% apraclonidine in their right eyes. examinations, including blood pressure, pulse rate, conjunctiva and cornea, intraocular pressure (iop), pupil diameter, basal tear secretion and margin reflex distance of both upper and lower eyelids, were performed prior to entry and at 1, 3, 5 and 7 hours after instillation. the ocular hypotensive effects were statistically significant for apraclonidine-treated eyes throughout the study and also statistically significant for contralateral eyes from three hours after topical administration of 1% apraclonidine. decreases in systolic blood pressure were statistically, but not clinically, significant. no significant changes in diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and basal tear secretion were noted. conjunctival blanching and mydriasis were commonly found. upper lid retraction was frequently noted. while the elevations of the upper lid margin in most subjects were not more than 2 mm and did not cause noticeable change in appearance, one subject suffered from mechanical entropion and marked corneal abrasion 3 hours after instillation of the medication. this may well be a particularly notable finding in asian people.;1;0;0;0

increased mental slowing associated with the apoe epsilon4 allele after trihexyphenidyl oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly.;objectives: the objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between apoe epsilon4 and subjective effects of trihexyphenidyl on measures reflecting sedation and confusion and to investigate the relationship between trihexyphenidyl-induced subjective effects and objective memory performance. methods: this study comprised 24 cognitively intact, health elderly adults (12 apoe epsilon4 carriers) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic. this was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, three-way, crossover experimental design. all participants received 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg trihexyphenidyl or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks. bond and lader's visual analog scales and alternate versions of the buschke selective reminding test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline, 1, 2.5, and 5 hours postdrug administration. results: a 2.0-mg oral dose of trihexyphenidyl resulted in increased subjective ratings of mental slowness in carriers of the apoe epsilon4 allele only. drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2.0 mg trihexyphenidyl and placebo on ratings of mental slowness significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the buschke selective reminding test in carriers of the apoe epsilon4 allele only. however, no significant effects were found with other visual analog scales reflecting subjective sedation and clear-headedness. conclusion: the epsilon4 allele in healthy elderly was associated with increased subjective mental slowing after trihexyphenidyl anticholinergic challenge.;0;0;1;0
an open-label phase ii study of low-dose thalidomide in androgen-independent prostate cancer.;"the antiangiogenic effects of thalidomide have been assessed in clinical trials in patients with various solid and haematological malignancies. thalidomide blocks the activity of angiogenic agents including bfgf, vegf and il-6. we undertook an open-label study using thalidomide 100 mg once daily for up to 6 months in 20 men with androgen-independent prostate cancer. the mean time of study was 109 days (median 107, range 4-184 days). patients underwent regular measurement of prostate-specific antigen (psa), urea and electrolytes, serum bfgf and vegf. three men (15%) showed a decline in serum psa of at least 50%, sustained throughout treatment. of 16 men treated for at least 2 months, six (37.5%) showed a fall in absolute psa by a median of 48%. increasing levels of serum bfgf and vegf were associated with progressive disease; five of six men who demonstrated a fall in psa also showed a decline in bfgf and vegf levels, and three of four men with a rising psa showed an increase in both growth factors. adverse effects included constipation, morning drowsiness, dizziness and rash, and resulted in withdrawal from the study by three men. evidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy was found in nine of 13 men before treatment. in the seven men who completed six months on thalidomide, subclinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy was found in four before treatment, but in all seven at repeat testing. the findings indicate that thalidomide may be an option for patients who have failed other forms of therapy, provided close follow-up is maintained for development of peripheral neuropathy.";0;0;1;1
decreased expression of brca1 accelerates growth and is often present during sporadic breast cancer progression.;we have characterized expression of the familial breast and ovarian cancer gene , brca1 , in cases of non-hereditary ( sporadic ) breast cancer and analyzed the effect of antisense inhibition of brca1 on the proliferative rate of mammary epithelial cells . brca1 mrna levels are markedly decreased during the transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer . experimental inhibition of brca1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides produced accelerated growth of normal and malignant mammary cells , but had no effect on non-mammary epithelial cells . these studies suggest that brca1 may normally serve as a negative regulator of mammary epithelial cell growth whose function is compromised in breast cancer either by direct mutation or alterations in gene expression . .;0;0;0;1

national project on the prevention of mother-to-infant infection by hepatitis b virus in japan.;in japan, a nationwide prevention program against mother-to-infant infection by hepatitis b virus (hbv) started in 1985. this program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) and hepatitis b e antigen (hbeag) positive mothers. these infants are treated with two injections of hepatitis b immune globulin (hbig) and at least three injections of plasma derived hepatitis b vaccine. we sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987. 93.4% pregnant women had the chance to be examined for hbsag, and the positive rate was 1.4 to 1.5%. the hbeag positive rate in hbsag positive was 23 to 26%. the hbsag positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3% and 2% respectively. some problems may arise, because 27 to 30% of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas.;0;1;1;0

the dna double-strand break repair gene hmre11 is mutated in individuals with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder.;we show that hypomorphic mutations in hmre11 , but not in atm , are present in certain individuals with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder ( atld ) . the cellular features resulting from these hmre11 mutations are similar to those seen in a-t as well as nbs and include hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation , radioresistant dna synthesis , and abrogation of atm-dependent events , such as the activation of jun kinase following exposure to gamma irradiation . although the mutant hmre11 proteins retain some ability to interact with hrad50 and nbs1 , formation of ionizing radiation-induced hmre11 and nbs1 foci was absent in hmre11 mutant cells . these data demonstrate that atm and the hmre11 / hrad50 / nbs1 protein complex act in the same dna damage response pathway and link hmre11 to the complex pathology of a-t . .;0;0;1;0
further evidence for a major ancient mutation underlying myotonic dystrophy from linkage disequilibrium studies in the japanese population.;the myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) mutation is an unstable ( ctg ) n repeat , present at a copy number of 5-37 repeats on normal chromosomes but amplified to 50-3000 copies on dm chromosomes . previous findings in caucasian populations of a dm founder chromosome raise a question about the molecular events involved in the expansion mutation . to investigate whether a founder chromosome for the dm mutation exists in the japanese population , we genotyped families using polymorphic markers near the ( ctg ) n repeat region and constructed haplotypes . six different haplotypes were found and dm alleles were always haplotype a . to find an origin of the ( ctg ) n repeat mutation and to investigate the mechanism of the expansion mutation in the japanese population we have studied 90 japanese dm families comprising 190 affected and 130 unaffected members . the results suggest that a few common ancestral mutations in both caucasian and japanese populations have originated by expansion of an ancestral n = 5 repeat to n = 19-37 copies . these data support multistep models of triplet repeat expansion that have been proposed for both dm and friedreichs ataxia . .;0;0;1;0

reversible inferior colliculus lesion in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy: magnetic resonance findings on diffusion-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging.;"objective: this is to present reversible inferior colliculus lesions in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (flair) imaging. materials and methods: from november 2005 to september 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (age range; 43-78 years). they had been taking metronidazole (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs. initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) were obtained after the hospitalization, including dwi (8/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) map (4/8), flair (7/8), and t2-weighted image (8/8). follow-up mris were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration. findings of initial and follow-up mris were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images. results: initial mris showed abnormal high signal intensities on dwi and flair (or t2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8/8), inferior colliculus (6/8), corpus callosum (2/8), pons (2/8), medulla (1/8), and bilateral cerebral white matter (1/8). high-signal intensity lesions on dwi tended to show low signal intensity on adc map (3/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only dwi but also adc map. all the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up mris in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted. conclusions: reversible inferior colliculus lesions could be considered as the characteristic for metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, next to the dentate nucleus involvement.";0;0;1;0

in vitro characterization of parasympathetic and sympathetic responses in cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat.;in cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat, detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered. whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated. responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 hz) in inflamed preparations. in both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meatp) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 hz). the muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-n-methylpiperidine (4-damp) ('m(1)/m(3)/m(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('m(2)-selective') and pirenzepine ('m(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. 4-damp inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. in inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-damp antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. in contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies. while contractions to carbachol and atp were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. thus, in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur. while postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased.;0;1;1;0

contribution of the glycine site of nmda receptors in rostral and intermediate-caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rats.;the aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the glycine site of nmda receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone. muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method, which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance (mmg) of the rat's hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity (emg) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint: gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. muscle rigidity was induced by haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7-dcka), a selective glycine site antagonist, injected in doses of 2.5 and 4.5 microg/0.5 microl bilaterally, into the rostral region of the striatum, decreased both the haloperidol-induced muscle rigidity (mmg) and the enhanced electromyographic activity (emg). 5,7-dcka injected bilaterally in a dose of 4.5 microg/0.5 microl into the intermediate-caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with haloperidol had no effect on the muscle tone. the present results suggest that blockade of the glycine site of nmda receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the antiparkinsonian action of this drug.;0;0;1;0
comparison of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy at doses up to 320/25 mg versus monotherapy: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by long-term combination therapy in hypertensive adults.;"background: one third of patients treated for hypertension attain adequate blood pressure (bp) control, and multidrug regimens are often required. given the lifelong nature of hypertension, there is a need to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of combination anti-hypertensive therapies. objective: this study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of valsartan (val) or hydrochlorothiazide (hctz)-monotherapy and higher-dose combinations in patients with essential hypertension. methods: the first part of this study was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group trial. patients with essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic bp [msdbp], > or =95 mm hg and <110 mm hg) were randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups: val 160 or 320 mg; hctz 12.5 or 25 mg; val/hctz 160/12.5, 320/12.5, or 320/25 mg; or placebo. mean changes in msdbp and mean sitting systolic bp (mssbp) were analyzed at the 8-week core study end point. val/hctz 320/12.5 and 320/25 mg were further investigated in a 54-week, open-label extension. response was defined as msdbp <90 mm hg or a > or =10 mm hg decrease compared to baseline. control was defined as msdbp <90 mm hg compared with baseline. tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events at randomization and all subsequent study visits and regular evaluation of hematology and blood chemistry. results: a total of 1346 patients were randomized into the 8-week core study (734 men, 612 women; 924 white, 291 black, 23 asian, 108 other; mean age, 52.7 years; mean weight, 92.6 kg). all active treatments were associated with significantly reduced mssbp and msdbp during the core 8-week study, with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy (val and hctz, p < 0.001). each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in mssbp and msdbp compared with the monotherapies and placebo (all, p < 0.001). the mean reduction in mssbp/msdbp with val/hctz 320/25 mg was 24.7/16.6 mm hg, compared with 5.9/7.0 mm hg with placebo. the reduction in mssbp was significantly greater with val/hctz 320/25 mg compared with val/hctz 160/12.5 mg (p < 0.002). rates of response and bp control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy. the incidence of hypokalemia was lower with val/hctz combinations (1.8%-6.1%) than with hctz monotherapies (7.1%-13.3%). the majority of adverse events in the core study were of mild to moderate severity. the efficacy and tolerability of val/hctz combinations were maintained during the extension (797 patients). conclusions: in this study population, combination therapies with val/hctz were associated with significantly greater bp reductions compared with either monotherapy, were well tolerated, and were associated with less hypokalemia than hctz alone.";1;0;1;0
hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone in a monitored patient.;we report a case of hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ecg) monitoring throughout the episode. there was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier. the patient was admitted with a pulmonary-renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. after receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. the ecg showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia. this study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (ivmp). these mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event. rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism.;1;1;1;0

hallucinations and ifosfamide-induced neurotoxicity.;"background: hallucinations as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of ifosfamide. most cases of ifosfamide-induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes. methods: the authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide-induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium. all patients were receiving high-dose ifosfamide as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure. results: hallucinations occurred only when the patient's eyes were closed and, in all but one case, were reported as disturbing or frightening. underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely. conclusions: hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity. the incidence may be dose and infusion-time related. the clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide-induced hallucinations, which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity. ""eyes-closed"" hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation. patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence. optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear. if agitation becomes marked, high-potency neuroleptics (i.e., haloperidol) may be effective.";0;0;1;0

antiarrhythmic effects of optical isomers of cibenzoline on canine ventricular arrhythmias.;antiarrhythmic effects of (+)-cibenzoline and (-)-cibenzoline were examined using two canine ventricular arrhythmia models. digitalis arrhythmia, which is suppressed by na channel blockers, was induced by intermittent intravenous (i.v.) injection of ouabain in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. adrenaline arrhythmia, which is suppressed by ca channel blockers, was induced by adrenaline infusion in halothane-anesthetized dogs. ten and 5 mg/kg i.v. (+)-cibenzoline suppressed digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias, respectively. the minimum effective plasma concentrations of (+)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- sd, n = 6). a lower dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. of (-)-cibenzoline suppressed the digitalis-induced arrhythmia, whereas 5 mg/kg i.v. was needed to suppress adrenaline-induced arrhythmias. the minimum effective plasma concentrations of (-)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmia were 0.06 +/- 0.04 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- sd, n = 6). the stronger antiarrhythmic effect of (-)-cibenzoline indicates that (-)-isomer may have an effect nearly 5-20 times stronger in suppressing na channels, but effects of both drugs on ca channels may be almost equipotent.;1;1;1;0

mr imaging with quantitative diffusion mapping of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity in organ transplant patients.;our objective was to investigate brain mr imaging findings and the utility of diffusion-weighted (dw) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy. brain mr studies, including dw imaging, were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications. in each patient who had abnormalities on the initial mr study, a follow-up mr study was performed 1 month later. apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) values on the initial mr study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions. of the 14 patients, 5 (35.7%) had white matter abnormalities, 1 (7.1%) had putaminal hemorrhage, and 8 (57.1%) had normal findings on initial mr images. among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities, 4 patients (80.0%) showed higher than normal adc values on initial mr images, and all showed complete resolution on follow-up images. the remaining 1 patient (20.0%) showed lower than normal adc value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis. diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity.;0;0;1;0

overexpression of copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase protects from kanamycin-induced hearing loss.;the participation of reactive oxygen species in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity has been deduced from observations that aminoglycoside-iron complexes catalyze the formation of superoxide radicals in vitro and that antioxidants attenuate ototoxicity in vivo. we therefore hypothesized that overexpression of cu/zn-superoxide dismutase (h-sod1) should protect transgenic mice from ototoxicity. immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of h-sod1 in inner ear tissues of transgenic c57bl/6-tgn[sod1]3cje mice. transgenic and nontransgenic littermates received kanamycin (400 mg/kg body weight/day) for 10 days beginning on day 10 after birth. auditory thresholds were tested by evoked auditory brain stem responses at 1 month after birth. in nontransgenic animals, the threshold in the kanamycin-treated group was 45-50 db higher than in saline-injected controls. in the transgenic group, kanamycin increased the threshold by only 15 db over the respective controls. the effects were similar at 12 and 24 khz. the protection by overexpression of superoxide dismutase supports the hypothesis that oxidant stress plays a significant role in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. the results also suggest transgenic animals as suitable models to investigate the underlying mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention.;0;0;1;0
long-term oral galactose treatment prevents cognitive deficits in male wistar rats treated intracerebroventricularly with streptozotocin.;basic and clinical research has demonstrated that dementia of sporadic alzheimer's disease (sad) type is associated with dysfunction of the insulin-receptor (ir) system followed by decreased glucose transport via glucose transporter glut4 and decreased glucose metabolism in brain cells. an alternative source of energy is d-galactose (the c-4-epimer of d-glucose) which is transported into the brain by insulin-independent glut3 transporter where it might be metabolized to glucose via the leloir pathway. exclusively parenteral daily injections of galactose induce memory deterioration in rodents and are used to generate animal aging model, but the effects of oral galactose treatment on cognitive functions have never been tested. we have investigated the effects of continuous daily oral galactose (200 mg/kg/day) treatment on cognitive deficits in streptozotocin-induced (stz-icv) rat model of sad, tested by morris water maze and passive avoidance test, respectively. one month of oral galactose treatment initiated immediately after the stz-icv administration, successfully prevented development of the stz-icv-induced cognitive deficits. beneficial effect of oral galactose was independent of the rat age and of the galactose dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg/kg/day. additionally, oral galactose administration led to the appearance of galactose in the blood. the increase of galactose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was several times lower after oral than after parenteral administration of the same galactose dose. oral galactose exposure might have beneficial effects on learning and memory ability and could be worth investigating for improvement of cognitive deficits associated with glucose hypometabolism in ad.;0;0;1;0
trinucleotide repeat expansion at the myotonic dystrophy locus reduces expression of dmahp.;myotonic dystrophy , or dystrophia myotonica ( dm ) , is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by the expansion of a ctg trinucleotide repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the dmpk protein kinase gene on chromosome 19q13 . 3 ( refs 1-3 ) . although the dm mutation was identified more than five years ago , the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this most prevalent form of hereditary adult neuromuscular disease remain elusive . previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a dnase l-hypersensitive site located adjacent to the repeats on the wild-type allele is eliminated by repeat expansion , indicating that large ctg-repeat arrays may be associated with a local chromatin environment that represses gene expression . here we report that the hypersensitive site contains an enhancer element that regulates transcription of the adjacent dmahp homeobox gene . analysis of dmahp expression in the cells of dm patients with loss of the hypersensitive site revealed a two- to fourfold reduction in steady-state dmahp transcript levels relative to wild-type controls . allele-specific analysis of dmahp expression showed that steady-state transcript levels from the expanded allele were greatly reduced in comparison to those from the wild-type allele . together , these results demonstrate that ctg-repeat expansions can suppress local gene expression and implicate dmahp in dm pathogenesis .;0;0;1;0

chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative (sm-5887) on normal heart and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs.;this study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of sm-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of sm-5887 on low-grade cardiotoxicity pre-induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs. in the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or sm-5887 (2.5 mg/kg). the experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing. animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ecg) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the sm-5887 administration did not show any changes in ecg, blood pressure and histopathological examinations. to examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of sm-5887, low-grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg). nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or sm-5887 (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. the low-grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment. on the contrary, the sm-5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy. in conclusion, sm-5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in dogs.;1;0;0;0

anticipation resulting in elimination of the myotonic dystrophy gene: a follow up study of one extended family.;we have re-examined an extended myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) family , previously described in 1955 , in order to study the long term effects of anticipation in dm and in particular the implications for families affected by this disease . this follow up study provides data on 35 gene carriers and 46 asymptomatic at risk family members in five generations . clinical anticipation , defined as the cascade of mild , adult , childhood , or congenital disease in subsequent generations , appeared to be a relentless process , occurring in all affected branches of the family . the cascade was found to proceed asynchronously in the different branches , mainly because of an unequal number of generations with mild disease . the transition from the mild to the adult type was associated with transmission through a male parent . stable transmission of the asymptomatic / mild phenotype showed a female transmission bias . we further examined the extent and causes of gene loss in this pedigree . gene loss in the patient group was complete , owing to infertility of the male patients with adult onset disease and the fact that mentally retarded patients did not procreate . out of the 46 at risk subjects in the two youngest generations , only one was found to have a full mutation . this is the only subject who may transmit the gene to the sixth generation . no protomutation carriers were found in the fourth and fifth generations . therefore it is highly probable that the dm gene will be eliminated from this pedigree within one generation . the high population frequency of dm can at present not be explained by the contribution of asymptomatic cases in the younger generations of known families , but is probably caused by the events in the ancestral generations . .;0;0;1;0

prenatal protein deprivation alters dopamine-mediated behaviors and dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptor binding.;epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of schizophrenia. the goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to schizophrenia. we report that prenatally protein deprived (pd) female rats showed an increased stereotypic response to apomorphine and an increased locomotor response to amphetamine in adulthood. these differences were not observed during puberty. no changes in haloperidol-induced catalepsy or mk-801-induced locomotion were seen following pd. in addition, pd female rats showed increased (3)h-mk-801 binding in the striatum and hippocampus, but not in the cortex. pd female rats also showed increased (3)h-haloperidol binding and decreased dopamine transporter binding in striatum. no statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in pd males with the exception of increased (3)h-mk-801 binding in cortex. this animal model may be useful to explore the mechanisms by which prenatal nutritional deficiency enhances risk for schizophrenia in humans and may also have implications for developmental processes leading to differential sensitivity to drugs of abuse.;0;0;1;0
late fulminant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant.;objectives: posterior leukoencephalopathy due to calcineurin-inhibitor-related neurotoxicity is a rare but severe complication that results from treatment with immunosuppressive agents (primarily those administered after a liver or kidney transplant). the pathophysiologic mechanisms of that disorder remain unknown. case: we report the case of a 46-year-old woman who received a liver transplant in our center as treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis and in whom either a fulminant course of posterior leukoencephalopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome developed 110 days after transplant. after an initially uneventful course after the transplant, the patient rapidly fell into deep coma. results: cerebral mri scan showed typical signs of enhancement in the pontine and posterior regions. switching the immunosuppressive regimen from tacrolimus to cyclosporine did not improve the clinical situation. the termination of treatment with any calcineurin inhibitor resulted in a complete resolution of that complication. conclusions: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant is rare. we recommend a complete cessation of any calcineurin inhibitor rather than a dose reduction.;0;1;1;0

curcumin ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damage in phenobarbitone and carbamazepine administered rats.;the antiepileptic drugs, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are well known to cause cognitive impairment on chronic use. the increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of cognitive impairment by antiepileptic drugs. curcumin has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective properties. therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone- and carbamazepine-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats. pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were also studied. vehicle/drugs were administered daily for 21days to male wistar rats. passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function. at the end of study period, serum phenobarbitone and carbamazepine, whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated. the administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress. concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs. curcumin co-administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phenobarbitone as well as carbamazepine. these results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentrations. the findings suggest that curcumin can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to phenobarbitone and carbamazepine therapy in preventing cognitive impairment associated with these drugs.;0;0;1;0

loss of normal allele of the apc gene in an adrenocortical carcinoma from a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis.;endocrine neoplasms have been reported occasionally in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) . an adrenocorotical carcinoma was studied in a patient with a family history of fap . loss of heterozygosity ( loh ) in the region close to the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) gene was detected in this carcinoma , and evidence was obtained that there was a loss of the normal allele of the apc gene . this is the first demonstration of loh at the apc locus in adrenocortical tumors . the present results and our previous data on loh in a recurring desmoid tumor suggest that the heterozygous mutant / wild-type condition of the apc gene may give rise to benign tumors , and that functional loss of this gene leads to development of tumors not only in the colon but also in other various parts of the body in fap patients . .;0;0;1;1
mefv-gene analysis in armenian patients with familial mediterranean fever: diagnostic value and unfavorable renal prognosis of the m694v homozygous genotype-genetic and therapeutic implications.;familial mediterranean fever ( fmf ) is a recessively inherited disorder that is common in patients of armenian ancestry . to date , its diagnosis , which can be made only retrospectively , is one of exclusion , based entirely on nonspecific clinical signs that result from serosal inflammation and that may lead to unnecessary surgery . renal amyloidosis , prevented by colchicine , is the most severe complication of fmf , a disorder associated with mutations in the mefv gene . to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of mefv-gene analysis , we investigated 90 armenian fmf patients from 77 unrelated families that were not selected through genetic-linkage analysis . eight mutations , one of which ( r408q ) is new , were found to account for 93 % of the 163 independent fmf alleles , with both fmf alleles identified in 89 % of the patients . in several instances , family studies provided molecular evidence for pseudodominant transmission and incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype . the m694v homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of renal amyloidosis and arthritis , compared with other genotypes ( p = . 0002 and p = . 006 , respectively ) . the demonstration of both the diagnostic and prognostic value of mefv analysis and particular modes of inheritance should lead to new ways for management of fmf-including genetic counseling and therapeutic decisions in affected families .;0;1;0;0

ifosfamide continuous infusion without mesna. a phase i trial of a 14-day cycle.;"twenty patients received 27 courses of ifosfamide administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 14 days without mesna. the goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with mesna. dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d. four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d. there were no instances of macroscopic hematuria. at 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion (1), nausea (1), and grade 2 leukopenia (1). the recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion. because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial. the frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine hematest is essential, adding mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria. the protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to  890 per cycle. clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained.";0;1;0;0

apomorphine: an underutilized therapy for parkinson's disease.;apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of parkinson's disease. while powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating parkinson's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study. a number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings. continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off-time by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add-on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or comt inhibitors. extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of apomorphine efficacy. in addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa-induced dyskinesias. the main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role. given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating parkinson's disease, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.;0;0;1;0
selegiline-induced postural hypotension in parkinson's disease: a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal.;objectives: the united kingdom parkinson's disease research group (ukpdrg) trial found an increased mortality in patients with parkinson's disease (pd) randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and l-dopa compared with those taking l-dopa alone. recently, we found that therapy with selegiline and l-dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline. this unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure. the aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension. methods: the cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in pd patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn. results: head-up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 pd patients on selegiline, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. a lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing. orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action. conclusion: this study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with l-dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension. the possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed.;1;0;1;0

adverse effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on nephrosclerosis in rats with renovascular hypertension.;the effect of a 6-week treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, albuminuria, renal hemodynamics, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertension. six weeks after clipping of one renal artery, hypertensive rats (178 +/- 4 mm hg) were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated hypertensive controls (n = 8), enalapril-treated (n = 8), or nitrendipine-treated (n = 10). sham-operated rats served as normotensive controls (128 +/- 3 mm hg, n = 8). after 6 weeks of treatment, renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow) were measured in the anesthetized rats. renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis. enalapril but not nitrendipine reduced blood pressure significantly. after 6 weeks of therapy, glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups. renal plasma flow increased, but albumin excretion and glomerulosclerosis did not change after enalapril treatment. in contrast, in the nitrendipine-treated group albuminuria increased from 12.8 +/- 2 progressively to 163 +/- 55 compared with 19.2 +/- 9 mg/24 hr in the hypertensive controls. furthermore, glomerulosclerosis index was significantly increased in the nitrendipine-treated group compared with the hypertensive controls (0.38 +/- 0.1 versus 0.13 +/- 0.04). in addition, glomerular size was higher in the nitrendipine-treated group (14.9 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2) but lower in the enalapril-treated group (11.5 +/- 0.15 10(-3) mm2) compared with the hypertensive controls (12.1 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2).(abstract truncated at 250 words);1;1;0;0

99mtc-glucarate for detection of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.;infarct-avid radiopharmaceuticals are necessary for rapid and timely diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. the animal model used to produce infarction implies artery ligation but chemical induction can be easily obtained with isoproterenol. a new infarct-avid radiopharmaceutical based on glucaric acid was prepared in the hospital radiopharmacy of the incmnsz. 99mtc-glucarate was easy to prepare, stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction. histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an infarct 18 h after isoproterenol administration. the rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys. thirty minutes after 99mtc-glucarate administration the standardised heart uptake value s(h)uv was 4.7 in infarcted rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats. rois drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4.4. the high image quality suggests that high contrast images can be obtained in humans and the 96 h stability makes it an ideal agent to detect, in patients, early cardiac infarction.;1;1;0;0

caffeine challenge test in panic disorder and depression with panic attacks.;our aim was to observe if patients with panic disorder (pd) and patients with major depression with panic attacks (mdp) (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition criteria) respond in a similar way to the induction of panic attacks by an oral caffeine challenge test. we randomly selected 29 patients with pd, 27 with mdp, 25 with major depression without panic attacks (md), and 28 healthy volunteers. the patients had no psychotropic drug for at least a 4-week period. in a randomized double-blind experiment performed in 2 occasions 7 days apart, 480 mg caffeine and a caffeine-free (placebo) solution were administered in a coffee form and anxiety scales were applied before and after each test. a total of 58.6% (n = 17) of patients with pd, 44.4% (n = 12) of patients with mdp, 12.0% (n = 3) of patients with md, and 7.1% (n= 2) of control subjects had a panic attack after the 480-mg caffeine challenge test (chi(2)(3) = 16.22, p = .001). the patients with pd and mdp were more sensitive to caffeine than were patients with md and healthy volunteers. no panic attack was observed after the caffeine-free solution intake. the patients with md had a lower heart rate response to the test than all the other groups (2-way analysis of variance, group by time interaction with greenhouse-geisser correction: f(3,762) = 2.85, p = .026). our data suggest that there is an association between panic attacks, no matter if associated with pd or mdp, and hyperreactivity to an oral caffeine challenge test.;1;0;0;0
high incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension associated with appetite suppressants in belgium.;primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, progressive and incurable disease, which has been associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs. the importance of this association was evaluated in belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants. thirty-five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months (1992-1994) in belgium. exposure to appetite-suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview. twenty-three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants, mainly fenfluramines, as compared with only 5 of the controls (66 versus 6%, p<0.0001). five patients died before the interview, all of them had taken appetite suppressants. in 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain, 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants. the patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill, and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. a policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite suppressants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hypertension. intake of appetite suppressants may accelerate the progression of the disease.;1;0;1;0
biochemical and structural analysis of missense mutations in n-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase causing mucopolysaccharidosis iva phenotypes.;"mucopolysaccharidosis iva ( mps iva ; omim # 253000 ) , a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of n -acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase ( galns ) , has variable clinical phenotypes . to date we have identified 65 missense mutations in the galns gene from mps iva patients , but the correlation between genotype and phenotype has remained unclear . we studied 17 missense mutations using biochemical approaches and 32 missense mutations , using structural analyses . fifteen missense mutations and two newly engineered active site mutations ( c79s , c79t ) were characterized by transient expression analysis . mutant proteins , except for c79s and c79t , were destabilized and detected as insoluble precursor forms while the c79s and c79t mutants were of a soluble mature size . mutants found in the severe phenotype had no activity . mutants found in the mild phenotype had a considerable residual activity ( 1 . 3-13 . 3 % of wild-type galns activity ) . sulfatases , including galns , are members of a highly conserved gene family sharing an extensive sequence homology . thus , a tertiary structural model of human galns was constructed from the x-ray crystal structure of n -acetylgalacto-samine-4-sulfatase and arylsulfatase a , using homology modeling , and 32 missense mutations were investigated . consequently , we propose that there are at least three different reasons for the severe phenotype  ( i ) destruction of the hydrophobic core or modification of the packing ; ( ii ) removal of a salt bridge to destabilize the entire conformation ; ( iii ) modification of the active site . in contrast , mild mutations were mostly located on the surface of the galns protein . these studies shed further light on the genotype-phenotype correlation of mps iva and structure-function relationship in the sulfatase family .";0;0;1;0

a novel compound, maltolyl p-coumarate, attenuates cognitive deficits and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo dementia models.;to develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection, we newly synthesized maltolyl p-coumarate by the esterification of maltol and p-coumaric acid. in the present study, we investigated whether maltolyl p-coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine-injected rats and in amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. maltolyl p-coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. we also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p-coumarate in vitro using sh-sy5y cells. cells were pretreated with maltolyl p-coumarate, before exposed to amyloid beta peptide(1-42), glutamate or h2o2. we found that maltolyl p-coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that maltolyl p-coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against alzheimer's disease that is characterized by wide spread neuronal death and progressive decline of cognitive function.;0;0;1;0

comparison of the respiratory effects of i.v. infusions of morphine and regional analgesia by extradural block.;the incidence of postoperative respiratory apnoea was compared between five patients receiving a continuous i.v. infusion of morphine (mean 73.6 mg) and five patients receiving a continuous extradural infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine (mean 192 mg) in the 24-h period following upper abdominal surgery. monitoring consisted of airflow detection by a carbon dioxide analyser, chest wall movement detected by pneumatic capsules, and continuous electrocardiograph recorded with a holter ambulatory monitor. both obstructive (p less than 0.05) and central apnoea (p less than 0.05) occurred more frequently in patients who had a morphine infusion. there was also a higher incidence of tachyarrhythmias (p less than 0.05) and ventricular ectopic beats (p less than 0.05) in the morphine infusion group.;1;0;0;0
screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department seizure patients.;objective: the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patients. methods: this prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation. plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine using enzyme-mediated immunoassay methodology. plasma samples with benzoylecgonine greater than 150 ng/ml or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng/ml were defined as positive. patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol-related seizure disorder, estimated time from seizure to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. results: fourteen of 248 (5.6%, 95% ci 2.7%-8.5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoylecgonine and no samples (0%, 95% ci 0-1.2%) were positive for amphetamine. positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse (p < 0.0005). conclusions: during this study period, routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield. as a result, routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population.;0;0;1;0
a deletion mutation in col17a1 in five austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa represents propagation of an ancestral allele.;patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa , a usually nonlethal form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa , have generalized blistering , nail dystrophy , patchy alopecia , and dental abnormalities . skin fragility in most cases is due to mutations in the gene encoding type xvii collagen ( col17a1 ) . recently , we reported five austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa who share the same col17a1 mutation . affected individuals in three families are homozygous for 4003deltc , whereas those in two others are compound heterozygotes . to determine if the occurrence of 4003deltc in these unrelated families signifies propagation of an ancestral allele or a mutational hot spot , haplotypes were determined for polymorphisms both within and flanking col17a1 . five intragenic polymorphisms were chosen based on their informativeness . one of these , not previously reported , was 2988 a or c that introduces a new restriction site for eco0109 i . all the 4003deltc alleles showed the same haplotype for these five polymorphic markers . fourteen microsatellite polymorphisms were selected based on their high heterozygosity and their location within 10q23-q25 near col17a1 . three families shared microsatellite polymorphisms covering at most 19 cm , whereas the others shared smaller regions consistent with cross-over events during passage of this mutation through several generations . these results indicate that 4003deltc occurs on a single ancestral allele . .;0;0;1;0

cognitive deterioration from long-term abuse of dextromethorphan: a case report.;"dextromethorphan (dm), the dextrorotatory isomer of 3-hydroxy-n-methylmorphinan, is the main ingredient in a number of widely available, over-the-counter antitussives. initial studies (bornstein 1968) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability. subsequently, however, several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature. the drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects, ranging from nausea, restlessness, insomnia, ataxia, slurred speech and nystagmus to mood changes, perceptual alterations, inattention, disorientation and aggressive behavior (rammer et al 1988; katona and watson 1986; isbell and fraser 1953; devlin et al 1985; mccarthy 1971; dodds and revai 1967; degkwitz 1964; hildebrand et al 1989). there have also been two reported fatalities from dm overdoses (fleming 1986). however, there are no reports describing the effects of chronic abuse. this report describes a case of cognitive deterioration resulting from prolonged use of dm.";0;0;1;0

heterodimer formation and activity in the human enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase.;one of the fundamental questions concerning expression and function of dimeric enzymes involves the impact of naturally occurring mutations on subunit assembly and heterodimer activity . this question is of particular interest for the human enzyme galactose-l-phosphate uridylyl-transferase ( galt ) , impairment of which results in the inherited metabolic disorder galactosemia , because many if not most patients studied to date are compound heterozygotes rather than true molecular homozygotes . furthermore , the broad range of phenotypic severity observed in these patients raises the possibility that allelic combination , not just allelic constitution , may play some role in determining outcome . in the work described herein , we have selected two distinct naturally occurring null mutations of galt , q188r and r333w , and asked the questions ( i ) what are the impacts of these mutations on subunit assembly , and ( ii ) if heterodimers do form , are they active ? to answer these questions , we have established a yeast system for the coexpression of epitope-tagged alleles of human galt and investigated both the extent of specific galt subunit interactions and the activity of defined heterodimer pools . we have found that both homodimers and heterodimers do form involving each of the mutant subunits tested and that both heterodimer pools retain substantial enzymatic activity . these results are significant not only in terms of their implications for furthering our understanding of galactosemia and galt holoenzyme structure-function relationships but also because the system described may serve as a model for similar studies of other complexes composed of multiple subunits . .;0;0;1;0

cocaine-induced brainstem seizures and behavior.;"a variety of abnormal sensory/motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult wky rats by mechanical (electrode implants) and dc electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine. the electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations. cocaine (40 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg/kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study. cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects. the abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, hyperactivity, hypersensitivity, ""beating drum"" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching. shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states. hypersensitivity to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation. these findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and dc electrical perturbation. cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates. cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated.";0;0;1;0
cephalothin-induced immune hemolytic anemia.;a patient with renal disease developed coombs-positive hemolytic anemia while receiving cephalothin therapy. an anti-cephalothin igg antibody was detected in the patient's serum and in the eluates from her erythrocytes. in addition, nonimmunologic binding of normal and patient's serum proteins to her own and cephalothin-coated normal red cells was demonstrated. skin tests and in vitro lymphocyte stimulation revealed that the patient was sensitized to cephalothin and also to ampicillin. careful investigation of drug-induced hemolytic anemias reveals the complexity of the immune mechanisms involved.;0;1;1;0
behavioral effects of mk-801 on reserpine-treated mice.;the effects of dizocilpine (mk-801), a noncompetitive n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by reserpine treatments. this study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for parkinson's disease, or tardive dyskinesia, and its response after glutamatergic blockage. reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia. reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy, which are signs suggestive of parkinson's disease. mk-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by reserpine. however, mk-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine-treated mice. reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice. on the other hand, reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice. mk-801 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine. pretreatment with reserpine (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy, whereas mk-801 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine. these results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal movements, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian-like and tardive dsykinesia signs. the glutamatergic blockage produced by nmda can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, catalepsy and tremor according to the employed model.;0;0;1;0

lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy after steroid injection at lateral epicondyle.;"background and objectives: this report aimed to present a case of lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy (lacnp) that occurred after a steroid injection in the lateral epicondyle to treat lateral epicondylitis in a 40-year-old woman. material and method: a 40-year-old woman presented with decreased sensation and paresthesia over her right lateral forearm; the paresthesia had occurred after a steroid injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before. her sensation of light touch and pain was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area. results: the sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (lacn) (6.2 uv) was lower than that of the left (13.1 uv). the difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50% reduction. she was diagnosed with right lacnp (mainly axonal involvement) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings. her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree. conclusion: this report describes the case of a woman with lacnp that developed after a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. an electrodiagnostic study, including a nerve conduction study of the lacn, was helpful to diagnose right lacnp and to find the passage of the lacn on the lateral epicondyle.";0;0;1;0
progestational agents and blood coagulation. vii. thromboembolic and other complications of oral contraceptive therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of blood coagulation factors: summary report of a ten-year study.;"during a ten-year period, 348 women were studied for a total of 5,877 patient months in four separate studies relating oral contraceptives to changes in hematologic parameters. significant increases in certain factors of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysin systems (factors i,ii,vii,viii,ix, and x and plasminogen) were observed in the treated groups. severe complications developed in four patients. all four had an abnormal blood coagulation profile, suggesting ""hypercoagulability"" before initiation of therapy. some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients; some increased further during therapy. one of these patients developed a myocardial infarction before receiving any medication, shortly after the base-line values were obtained. one patient developed retinopathy 19 months after she began therapy, and another developed thrombophlebitis after 27 months of therapy. the fourth patient developed thrombophlebitis 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy. all four patients were of the a or ab blood group. previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for thromboembolic episodes in patients possessing the a antigen. it appears from these data that hematologic work-ups may be useful in women who are about to start long-term oral contraceptive therapy.";1;0;1;0
urinary bladder cancer in wegener's granulomatosis: risks and relation to cyclophosphamide.;objective: to assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer, and its relation to cyclophosphamide, in patients with wegener's granulomatosis. methods: in the population based, nationwide swedish inpatient register a cohort of 1065 patients with wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified. through linkage with the swedish cancer register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified. nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (ors) as relative risk. in the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after wegener's granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of wegener's granulomatosis, were also estimated. results: the median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. the risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide (or = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.8 to 4.9). treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (or = 7.7, 95% ci 0.9 to 69). the absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of wegener's granulomatosis, and a history of bladder cancer was (non-significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of wegener's granulomatosis. conclusion: the results indicate a dose-response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before wegener's granulomatosis.;0;0;0;1

neurotoxicity of halogenated hydroxyquinolines: clinical analysis of cases reported outside japan.;an analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated hydroxyquinolines reported from outside japan. in 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of clioquinol could be excluded. of the remainder, a relationship to clioquinol was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases. in six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of clioquinol over a short period. the most common manifestation, observed in 15 further cases, was isolated optic atrophy. this was most frequently found in children, many of whom had received clioquinol as treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica. in the remaining cases, a combination of myelopathy, visual disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifestation. isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy, or these manifestations occurring together, were infrequent. the onset of all manifestations (except toxic encephalopathy) was usually subacute, with subsequent partial recovery. older subjects tended to display more side effects. the full syndrome of subacute myelo-optic neuropathy was more frequent in women, but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug.;0;0;1;0

the role of p-aminophenol in acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity: effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate on acetaminophen and p-aminophenol nephrotoxicity and metabolism in fischer 344 rats.;acetaminophen (apap) produces proximal tubular necrosis in fischer 344 (f344) rats. recently, p-aminophenol (pap), a known potent nephrotoxicant, was identified as a metabolite of apap in f344 rats. the purpose of this study was to determine if pap formation is a requisite step in apap-induced nephrotoxicity. therefore, the effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (bnpp), an acylamidase inhibitor, on apap and pap nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined. bnpp (1 to 8 mm) reduced apap deacetylation and covalent binding in f344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner. pretreatment of animals with bnpp prior to apap or pap administration resulted in marked reduction of apap (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity but not pap nephrotoxicity. this result was not due to altered disposition of either apap or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue. rather, bnpp pretreatment reduced the fraction of apap excreted as pap by 64 and 75% after apap doses of 750 and 900 mg/kg. bnpp did not alter the excretion of apap or any of its non-deacetylated metabolites nor did bnpp alter excretion of pap or its metabolites after pap doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg. therefore, the bnpp-induced reduction in apap-induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of apap deacetylation. it is concluded that pap formation, in vivo, accounts, at least in part, for apap-induced renal tubular necrosis.;0;1;0;0
mutations in the gene for x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in patients with different clinical phenotypes.;"recently , the gene for the most common peroxisomal disorder , x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( x-ald ) , has been described encoding a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein . we analyzed the entire protein-coding sequence of this gene by reverse-transcription pcr , sscp , and dna sequencing in five patients with different clinical expression of x-ald and in their female relatives ; these clinical expressions were cerebral childhood ald , adrenomyeloneuropathy ( amn ) , and "" addison disease only "" ( ado ) phenotype . in the three patients exhibiting the classical picture of severe childhood ald we identified in the 5 portion of the x-ald gene a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation , a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an amino acid in the atp-binding domain of the ald protein , and a missense mutation . in the patient with the clinical phenotype of amn , a nonsense mutation in codon 212 , along with a second site mutation at codon 178 , was observed . analysis of the patient with the ado phenotype revealed a further missense mutation at a highly conserved position in the aldp / pmp70 comparison . the disruptive nature of two mutations ( i . e . , the frameshift and the nonsense mutation ) in patients with biochemically proved childhood ald and amn further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this gene play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of x-ald . since the current biochemical techniques for x-ald carrier detection in affected families lack sufficient reliability , our procedure described for systematic mutation scanning is also capable of improving genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis";0;0;1;0

expression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in vivo.;doxorubicin is an anti-tumor agent that represses cardiac-specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis. doxorubicin depletes cardiac p300, a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes. however, the role of p300 in protection against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis is unknown. transgenic mice overexpressing p300 in the heart and wild-type mice were subjected to doxorubicin treatment. compared with wild-type mice, transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha-sarcomeric actin. doxorubicin induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild-type mice but not in transgenic mice. expression of p300 increased the cardiac level of bcl-2 and mdm-2, but not that of p53 or other members of the bcl-2 family. these findings demonstrate that overexpression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo.;1;0;0;1
incidence of postoperative delirium is high even in a population without known risk factors.;"purpose: postoperative delirium is a recognized complication in populations at risk. the aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of early postoperative delirium in a population without known risk factors admitted to the icu for postoperative monitoring after elective major surgery. the secondary outcome investigated is to identify eventual independent risk factors among demographic data and anesthetic drugs used. methods: an observational, prospective study was conducted on a consecutive cohort of patients admitted to our icu within and for at least 24 h after major surgical procedures. exclusion criteria were any preexisting predisposing factor for delirium or other potentially confounding neurological dysfunctions. patients were assessed daily using the confusion assessment method for the icu scale for 3 days after the surgical procedure. early postoperative delirium incidence risk factors were then assessed through three different multiple regression models. results: according to the confusion assessment method for the icu scale, 28 % of patients were diagnosed with early postoperative delirium. the use of thiopentone was significantly associated with an eight-fold-higher risk for delirium compared to propofol (57.1% vs. 7.1%, rr = 8.0, x2 = 4.256; df = 1; 0.05 < p < 0.02). conclusion: in this study early postoperative delirium was found to be a very common complication after major surgery, even in a population without known risk factors. thiopentone was independently associated with an increase in its relative risk.";0;0;1;0
recombinations in individuals homozygous by descent localize the friedreich ataxia locus in a cloned 450-kb interval.;the locus for friedreich ataxia ( frda ) , a severe neurodegenerative disease , is tightly linked to markers d9s5 and d9s15 , and analysis of rare recombination events has suggested the order cen-frda-d9s5-d9s15-qter . we report here the construction of a yac contig extending 800 kb centromeric to d9s5 and the isolation of five new microsatellite markers from this region . in order to map these markers with respect to the frda locus , all within a 1-cm confidence interval , we sought to increase the genetic information of available frda families by considering homozygosity by descent and association with founder haplotypes in isolated populations . this approach allowed us to identify one phase-known recombination and one probable historic recombination on haplotypes from reunion island patients , both of which place three of the five markers proximal to frda . this represents the first identification of close frda flanking markers on the centromeric side . the two other markers allowed us to narrow the breakpoint of a previously identified distal recombination that is > 180 kb from d9s5 ( 26p ) . taken together , the results place the frda locus in a 450-kb interval , which is small enough for direct search of candidate genes . a detailed rare cutter restriction map and a cosmid contig covering this interval were constructed and should facilitate the search of genes in this region . .;0;0;1;0

diverse point mutations result in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) polymorphism in taiwan.;"glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ; ec 1 .1 . 1 . 49 ) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy , affecting more than 200 million people worldwide . although greater than 400 variants have been described based on clinical and biochemical criteria , little is known about the molecular basis of these g6pd deficiencies . recently , the gene that encodes human g6pd has been cloned and sequenced , which enables us to examine directly the heterogeneity of g6pd at the dna level . during the past 10 years , we examined the g6pd activity in 21 , 271 newborn chinese infants ( 11 , 400 males and 9 , 871 females ) and identified 314 ( 2 . 8 % ) males and 246 ( 2 . 5 % ) females having low g6pd activity . the g6pd gene from 10 randomly selected affected individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) amplified , subcloned , and sequenced . our results indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible for the g6pd polymorphism in taiwan . the first type of mutation ( 487 g----a ) was found in an affected chinese with a g to a change at nucleotide 487 , which results in a ( 163 ) gly to ser substitution . the second type of mutation ( 493 a----g ) is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic group and was identified in two affected chinese . this mutation causes an a to g change at nucleotide position 493 , producing an ( 165 ) asn to asp substitution . interestingly , the 487 g----a and 493 a----g mutations create alu i and ava ii recognition sites , respectively , which enabled us to rapidly detect these two mutations by pcr / restriction enzyme ( re ) digestion method . the third mutation ( 1376 g----t ) was found in four affected chinese . this mutation causes a g to t change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an ( 459 ) arg to leu substitution . the 1376 g----t mutation seems to be the dominant allele that causes g6pd deficiency in taiwan . finally , two affected chinese were identified as having the fourth mutation ( 1388 g----a ) . this mutation causes a g to a change at nucleotide 1388 that produces an ( 463 ) arg to his substitution . our studies provide the direct proof of the genetic heterogeneity of g6pd deficiency in the chinese populations of taiwan and the pcr / re digestion method is suitable for simultaneous detection of the 487 g----a and 493 a----g mutations .";0;0;1;0
centrosome amplification and a defective g2-m cell cycle checkpoint induce genetic instability in brca1 exon 11 isoform-deficient cells.;germline mutations of the brca1 tumor suppressor gene predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers . to study mechanisms underlying brca1-related tumorigenesis , we derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted deletion of exon 11 of the brca1 gene . we show that the mutant cells maintain an intact g1-s cell cycle checkpoint and proliferate poorly . however , a defective g2-m checkpoint in these cells is accompanied by extensive chromosomal abnormalities . mutant fibroblasts contain multiple , functional centrosomes , which lead to unequal chromosome segregation , abnormal nuclear division , and aneuploidy . these data uncover an essential role of brca1 in maintaining genetic stability through the regulation of centrosome duplication and the g2-m checkpoint and provide a molecular basis for the role of brca1 in tumorigenesis . .;0;0;1;1

flurothyl seizure thresholds in mice treated neonatally with a single injection of monosodium glutamate (msg): evaluation of experimental parameters in flurothyl seizure testing.;"monosodium glutamate (msg) administration to neonatal rodents produces convulsions and results in numerous biochemical and behavioral deficits. these studies were undertaken to determine if neonatal administration of msg produced permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility, since previous investigations were inconclusive. a flurothyl ether seizure screening technique was used to evaluate seizure susceptibility in adult mice that received neonatal injections of msg (4 mg/g and 1 mg/g). msg treatment resulted in significant reductions in whole brain weight but did not alter seizure threshold. a naloxone (5 mg/kg) challenge was also ineffective in altering the seizure thresholds of either control of msg-treated mice. flurothyl ether produced hypothermia which was correlated with the duration of flurothyl exposure; however, the relationship of hypothermia to seizure induction was unclear. flurothyl seizure testing proved to be a rapid and reliable technique with which to evaluate seizure susceptibility.";0;0;1;0

hemorrhagic cystitis complicating bone marrow transplantation.;hemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious complication of high-dose cyclophosphamide therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation. as standard practice at our institution, patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation. in an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation, we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with mesna, which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes hemorrhagic cystitis. of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis, 4 had symptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis. in contrast, two of four consecutive patients who received mesna uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 weeks. because of this suboptimal result, we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis.;0;1;0;0

high-dose testosterone is associated with atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women.;"objectives: to study the long-term effects of androgen treatment on atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women. methods: in a population-based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54-67 years, we studied the association between self-reported intramuscularly administered high-dose estrogen-testosterone therapy (estradiol- and testosterone esters) and aortic atherosclerosis. aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta, which have been shown to reflect intima atherosclerosis. hormone therapy users were compared with never users. results: intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women. in almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present (n=11), while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20% (or 3.1; 95% ci, 1.1-8.5, adjusted for age, years since menopause, smoking, and body mass index). the association remained after additional adjustment for diabetes, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, or alcohol use. no association was found for hormone use less than 1 year. conclusion: our results suggest that high-dose testosterone therapy may adversely affect atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women and indicate that androgen replacement in these women may not be harmless.";1;0;0;0
effects of the novel compound aniracetam (ro 13-5057) upon impaired learning and memory in rodents.;"the effect of aniracetam (ro 13-5057, 1-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone) was studied on various forms of experimentally impaired cognitive functions (learning and memory) in rodents and produced the following effects: (1) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session; (2) partial (rats) or complete (mice) prevention of the scopolamine-induced short-term amnesia for a passive avoidance task; (3) complete protection against amnesia for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition; (4) prevention of the long-term retention- or retrieval-deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by chloramphenicol or cycloheximide administered immediately after acquisition; (5) reversal, when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test, of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by cycloheximide injected 2 days previously; (6) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or hypercapnia applied immediately before retrieval testing (24 h after acquisition). these improvements or normalizations of impaired cognitive functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10-100 mg/kg. generally, the dose-response curves were bell-shaped. the mechanisms underlying the activity of aniracetam and its 'therapeutic window' are unknown. piracetam, another pyrrolidinone derivative was used for comparison. it was active only in six of nine tests and had about one-tenth the potency of aniracetam. the results indicate that aniracetam improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process.";0;0;1;0
kidney function and morphology after short-term combination therapy with cyclosporine a, tacrolimus and sirolimus in the rat.;background: sirolimus (srl) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation. these are nephrotoxic, but srl seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects, although this question is still open. in a number of treatment protocols where srl was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described. the aim of this study was to examine further the renal function, including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male sprague-dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine a (csa), tacrolimus (fk506) or srl as monotherapies or in different combinations. methods: for a period of 2 weeks, csa 15 mg/kg/day (given orally), fk506 3.0 mg/kg/day (given orally) or srl 0.4 mg/kg/day (given intraperitoneally) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in sprague-dawley rats. in the 'conscious catheterized rat' model, the glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was measured as the clearance of cr(edta). the morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi-quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis, subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with sirius red. results: csa, fk506 and srl all significantly decreased the gfr. a further deterioration was seen when csa was combined with either fk506 or srl, whereas the gfr remained unchanged in the group treated with fk506 plus srl when compared with treatment with any of the single substances. the morphological changes presented a similar pattern. the semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with csa plus srl (p<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (p<0.02). the fk506 plus srl combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls (p=0.05). conclusion: this rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of csa plus srl, whereas fk506 plus srl was better tolerated.;0;1;1;0

fabry disease: identification of novel alpha-galactosidase a mutations and molecular carrier detection by use of fluorescent chemical cleavage of mismatches.;fabry disease ( fd ) ( angiokeratoma corporis diffusum ) is an x-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by defects in the lysosomal alpha-galactosidase a gene ( gla ) . the enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties . clinically , affected hemizygous males have angiokeratoma , severe acroparesthesia , renal failure , and vasculopathy of the heart and brain . while demonstration of alpha-galactosidase deficiency in leukocytes is diagnostic in affected males , enzymatic detection of female carriers is often inconclusive , due to random x-chromosomal inactivation , underlining the need of molecular investigations for accurate genetic counseling . by use of chemical cleavage of mismatches adapted to fluorescence-based detection systems , we have characterized the mutations underlying alpha-gal a deficiency in 16 individuals from six unrelated families with fd . the mutational spectrum included five missense mutations ( c202w , c223g , n224d , r301q , and q327k ) and one splice-site mutation [ ivs3 g ( -1 ) -- > c ] . studies at the mrna level showed that the latter led to altered pre-mrna splicing with consequent alteration of the mrna translational reading frame and generation of a premature termination codon of translation . by use of this strategy , carrier status was accurately assessed in all seven at-risk females tested , whereas enzymatic dosages failed to diagnose or exclude heterozygosity . .;1;1;1;0
type iii collagen is crucial for collagen i fibrillogenesis and for normal cardiovascular development.;type iii collagen is a fibrillar forming collagen comprising three alpha1 ( iii ) chains and is expressed in early embryos and throughout embryogenesis . in the adult , type iii collagen is a major component of the extracellular matrix in a variety of internal organs and skin . mutations in the col3a1 gene have been implicated as a cause of type iv ehlers-danlos syndrome , a disease leading to aortic rupture in early adult life . to directly study the role of col3a1 in development and disease , we have inactivated the col3a1 gene in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination . the mutated allele was transmitted through the mouse germ line and homozygous mutant animals were derived from heterozygous intercrosses . about 10 % of the homozygous mutant animals survived to adulthood but have a much shorter life span compared with wild-type mice . the major cause of death of mutant mice was rupture of the major blood vessels , similar to patients with type iv ehlers-danlos syndrome . ultrastructural analysis of tissues from mutant mice revealed that type iii collagen is essential for normal collagen i fibrillogenesis in the cardiovascular system and other organs . .;1;0;0;0

genotype-phenotype correlations in attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli.;germ-line mutations of the tumor suppressor apc are implicated in attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( aapc ) , a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) . aapc is recognized by the occurrence of colonic adenomas and a later onset of colorectal cancer ( age > 40 years ) . the aim of this study was to assess genotype-phenotype correlations in aapc families . by protein-truncation test ( ptt ) assay , the entire coding region of the apc gene was screened in affected individuals from 11 aapc kindreds , and their phenotypic differences were examined . five novel germ-line apc mutations were identified in seven kindreds . mutations were located in three different regions of the apc gene  ( 1 ) at the 5 end spanning exons 4 and 5 , ( 2 ) within exon 9 , and ( 3 ) at the 3 distal end of the gene . variability in the number of colorectal adenomas was most apparent in individuals with mutations in region 1 , and upper-gastrointestinal manifestations were more severe in them . in individuals with mutations in either region 2 or region 3 , the average number of adenomas tended to be lower than those in individuals with mutations in region 1 , although age at diagnosis was similar . in all aapc kindreds , a predominance of right-sided colorectal adenomas and rectal polyp sparing was observed . no desmoid tumors were found in these kindreds . our data suggest that , in aapc families , the location of the apc mutation may partially predict specific phenotypic expression . this should help in the design of tailored clinical-management protocols in this subset of fap patients . .;0;0;0;1

cardiovascular dysfunction and hypersensitivity to sodium pentobarbital induced by chronic barium chloride ingestion.;barium-supplemented long-evans hooded rats were characterized by a persistent hypertension that was evident after 1 month of barium (100 micrograms/ml mineral fortified water) treatment. analysis of in vivo myocardial excitability, contractility, and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant barium-induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system. the most distinctive aspect of the barium effect was a demonstrated hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital. under barbiturate anesthesia, virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium-exposed rats relative to the corresponding control-fed rats. the lack of a similar response to ketamine and xylazine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium-treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic, and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response. other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest, irrespective of the anesthetic employed. the contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium-treated rats relative to the control groups, irrespective of the anesthetic regimen. similarly, significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium-exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity. in addition, the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium-exposed rats. overall, the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics, the myocardial metabolic disturbances, and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed cardiomyopathic disorder induced by chronic barium exposure. these experimental findings represent the first indication that life-long barium ingestion may have significant adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system.;1;0;1;0

haim-munk syndrome and papillon-lefevre syndrome are allelic mutations in cathepsin c.;"of the many palmoplantar keratoderma ( ppk ) conditions , only papillon-lefevre syndrome ( pls ) and haim-munk syndrome ( hms ) are associated with premature periodontal destruction . although both pls and hms share the cardinal features of ppk and severe periodontitis , a number of additional findings are reported in hms including arachnodactyly , acro-osteolysis , atrophic changes of the nails , and a radiographic deformity of the fingers . while pls cases have been identified throughout the world , hms has only been described among descendants of a religious isolate originally from cochin , india . parental consanguinity is a characteristic of many cases of both conditions . although autosomal recessive transmission of pls is evident , a more "" complex "" autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance with phenotypic influences from a closely linked modifying locus has been hypothesised for hms . recently , mutations of the cathepsin c gene have been identified as the underlying genetic defect in pls . to determine if a cathepsin c mutation is also responsible for hms , we sequenced the gene in affected and unaffected subjects from the cochin isolate in which both the pls and hms phenotypes appear . here we report identification of a mutation of cathepsin c ( exon 6 , 2127a-- > g ) that changes a highly conserved amino acid in the cathepsin c peptide . this mutation segregates with hms in four nuclear families . additionally , the existence of a shared common haplotype for genetic loci flanking the cathepsin c gene suggests that affected subjects descended from the cochin isolate are homozygous for a mutation inherited "" identical by descent "" from a common ancestor . this finding supports simple autosomal recessive inheritance for hms in these families . we also report a mutation of the same exon 6 ctsc codon ( 2126c-- > t ) in a turkish family with classical pls . these findings provide evidence that pls and hms are allelic variants of cathepsin c gene mutations . .";0;0;1;0

high fat diet-fed obese rats are highly sensitive to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.;often, chemotherapy by doxorubicin (adriamycin) is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy. recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. this cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, atp synthesis, and upregulated jak/stat3 pathway. in the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (hfd), which induces obesity in male sprague-dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. a ld(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the hfd feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese (ob) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (nd) and ob hearts. mechanistic studies revealed that ob rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in nd versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in ob), (5) decreased mitochondrial amp-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac atp levels accompanied by decreased atp/adp ratio after doxorubicin administration. decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased socs3 further downregulated the cardioprotective jak/stat3 pathway. in conclusion, hfd-induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial atp generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the jak/stat3 pathway.;1;1;0;0
influence of pax6 gene dosage on development: overexpression causes severe eye abnormalities.;aniridia in man and small eye in mice are semidominant developmental disorders caused by mutations within the paired box gene pax6 . whereas heterozygotes suffer from iris hypoplasia , homozygous mice lack eyes and nasal cavities and exhibit brain abnormalities . to investigate the role of gene dosage in more detail , we have generated yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice carrying the human pax6 locus . when crossed onto the small eye background , the transgene rescues the mutant phenotype . strikingly , mice carrying multiple copies on a wild-type background show specific developmental abnormalities of the eye , but not of other tissues expressing the gene . thus , at least five different eye phenotypes are associated with changes in pax6 expression . we provide evidence that not only reduced , but also increased levels of transcriptional regulators can cause developmental defects . .;0;0;1;0
the effect of haloperidol in cocaine and amphetamine intoxication.;the effectiveness of haloperidol pretreatment in preventing the toxic effects of high doses of amphetamine and cocaine was studied in rats. in this model, toxic effects were induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of amphetamine 75 mg/kg (100% death rate) or cocaine 70 mg/kg (82% death rate). haloperidol failed to prevent amphetamine-induced seizures, but did lower the mortality rate at most doses tested. haloperidol decreased the incidence of cocaine-induced seizures at the two highest doses, but the lowering of the mortality rate did not reach statistical significance at any dose. these data suggest a protective role for the central dopamine blocker haloperidol against death from high-dose amphetamine exposure without reducing the incidence of seizures. in contrast, haloperidol demonstrated an ability to reduce cocaine-induced seizures without significantly reducing mortality.;0;0;1;0

cardioprotective effect of salvianolic acid a on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.;the present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid a on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. hemodynamic parameters and lead ii electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously. cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured. assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed. isoproterenol-treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart. these rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure, and elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and st-segment. in addition, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and adp/o was observed in isoproterenol-treated rats. administration of salvianolic acid a for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function. the protective role of salvianolic acid a against isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. the results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid a possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction.;1;1;0;0
l-arginine transport in humans with cortisol-induced hypertension.;"a deficient l-arginine-nitric oxide system is implicated in cortisol-induced hypertension. we investigate whether abnormalities in l-arginine uptake contribute to this deficiency. eight healthy men were recruited. hydrocortisone acetate (50 mg) was given orally every 6 hours for 24 hours after a 5-day fixed-salt diet (150 mmol/d). crossover studies were performed 2 weeks apart. thirty milliliters of blood was obtained for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after each treatment period. l-arginine uptake was assessed in mononuclear cells incubated with l-arginine (1 to 300 micromol/l), incorporating 100 nmol/l [3h]-l-arginine for a period of 5 minutes at 37 degrees c. forearm [3h]-l-arginine extraction was calculated after infusion of [3h]-l-arginine into the brachial artery at a rate of 100 nci/min for 80 minutes. deep forearm venous samples were collected for determination of l-arginine extraction. plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly raised during the active phase (323+/-43 to 1082+/-245 mmol/l, p<0.05). systolic blood pressure was elevated by an average of 7 mm hg. neither l-arginine transport into mononuclear cells (placebo vs active, 26.3+/-3.6 vs 29.0+/-2.1 pmol/10 000 cells per 5 minutes, respectively, at an l-arginine concentration of 300 micromol/l) nor l-arginine extraction in the forearm (at 80 minutes, placebo vs active, 1 868 904+/-434 962 vs 2 013 910+/-770 619 disintegrations per minute) was affected by cortisol treatment; ie, that l-arginine uptake is not affected by short-term cortisol treatment. we conclude that cortisol-induced increases in blood pressure are not associated with abnormalities in the l-arginine transport system.";1;0;0;0

expression of the von hippel-lindau disease tumour suppressor gene during human embryogenesis.;the von hippel-lindau ( vhl ) disease product is thought to down-regulate transcription by antagonizing elongin-enhanced transcriptional elongation . germline vhl gene mutations predispose to the development of retinal , cerebellar and spinal haemangioblastomas , renal cell carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma . in addition , somatic inactivation of the vhl gene is frequent in sporadic renal cell carcinoma and haemangioblastoma . regulation of transcript elongation is an important control mechanism for gene expression and the vhl gene might modify the expression of proto-oncogenes and growth suppressor genes during embryogenesis . we therefore investigated the expression of vhl mrna during human embryogenesis by in situ hybridization studies at 4 , 6 and 10 weeks post conception . although vhl mrna was expressed in all three germ layers , strong expression was noted in the central nervous system , kidneys , testis and lung . within the kidney , vhl mrna was differentially expressed within renal tubules suggesting that the vhl gene product may have a specific role in kidney development . two alternatively spliced vhl mrnas characterized by inclusion ( isoform i ) or exclusion ( isoform ii ) of exon 2 are transcribed in adult tissues . to investigate if the two isoforms are differentially expressed during embryogenesis , vhl mrna was reverse transcribed from 13 fetal tissues ( 8-10 weeks gestation ) . the quantitative distribution of vhl mrna within fetal tissues reflected that seen by in situ hybridization and the ratio of the two vhl isoforms was similar between tissues . although the genes regulated by the vhl gene product have not yet been identified , our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that vhl-mediated control of transcriptional elongation may have a role in normal human development . .;0;1;1;1

metformin prevents experimental gentamicin-induced nephropathy by a mitochondria-dependent pathway.;the antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients. here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity. mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive oxygen species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration. metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin-mediated acute renal failure. this was accompanied by a lower activity of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems. metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration. these in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function. we found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, nadh), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. these injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by metformin. thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.;0;1;1;0
germline brca1 alterations in a population-based series of ovarian cancer cases.;the objective of this study was to provide more accurate frequency estimates of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 ( brca1 ) germline alterations in the ovarian cancer population . to achieve this , we determined the prevalence of brca1 alterations in a population-based series of consecutive ovarian cancer cases . this is the first population-based ovarian cancer study reporting brca1 alterations derived from a comprehensive screen of the entire coding region . one hundred and seven ovarian cancer cases were analyzed for brca1 alterations using the rnase mismatch cleavage assay followed by direct sequencing . two truncating mutations , 962del4 and 3600del11 , were identified . both patients had a family history of breast or ovarian cancer . several novel as well as previously reported uncharacterized variants were also identified , some of which were associated with a family history of cancer . the frequency distribution of common polymorphisms was determined in the 91 caucasian cancer cases in this series and 24 sister controls using allele-specific amplification . the rare form of the q356r polymorphism was significantly ( p = 0 . 03 ) associated with a family history of ovarian cancer , suggesting that this polymorphism may influence ovarian cancer risk . in summary , our data suggest a role for some uncharacterized variants and rare forms of polymorphisms in determining ovarian cancer risk , and highlight the necessity to screen for missense alterations as well as truncating mutations in this population .;0;0;1;1

complex glycerol kinase deficiency: molecular-genetic, cytogenetic, and clinical studies of five japanese patients.;five male japanese patients with complex glycerol kinase deficiency ( cgkd ) and their relatives were studied clinically , cytogenetically , and molecular-genetically . all patients had muscular dystrophy or muscle weakness , mental retardation , congenital adrenal hypoplasia , and glycerol kinase deficiency . high-resolution gtg-banded chromosomes showed a microdeletion in the xp21 region in all four patients examined and in all five mothers . southern hybridizations , after digestions by restriction endonucleases , with various cloned dnas ( d2 , 99-6 , b24 , c7 , l1-4 , cdmd13-14 , j66-hi , p20 , j-bir , ert87-30 , ert87-15 , ert87-8 , ert87-1 , xj-1 . 1 , 754 , cx5 . 7 , and otc-1 ) that are located around xp21 also showed a deletion in the genome of all patients and mothers . although the deletion differed in size among patients , a segment commonly absent was located between the genomic sequences corresponding to l1-4 and cdmd13-14 . this finding indicated that the gene coding for glycerol kinase ( gk ) is located within this segment . a comparison of the clinical manifestations of the present five patients and reported cgkd or duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) patients with dna deletion suggests the existence of a certain gene responsible for gonadotropin deficiency ( gtd ) . the result of the present study and results of previous studies suggest that genes for ornithine transcarbamylase ( otc ) , dmd , and gk and putative genes responsible for congenital adrenal hypoplasia ( ahc ) and gtd are arranged from telomere to centromere as pter--gtd--ahc--gk--dmd--otc--cen;0;1;1;0
genetic heterogeneity and penetrance analysis of the brca1 and brca2 genes in breast cancer families.;the breast cancer linkage consortium. the contribution of brca1 and brca2 to inherited breast cancer was assessed by linkage and mutation analysis in 237 families , each with at least four cases of breast cancer , collected by the breast cancer linkage consortium . families were included without regard to the occurrence of ovarian or other cancers . overall , disease was linked to brca1 in an estimated 52 % of families , to brca2 in 32 % of families , and to neither gene in 16 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 6 % -28 % ) , suggesting other predisposition genes . the majority ( 81 % ) of the breast-ovarian cancer families were due to brca1 , with most others ( 14 % ) due to brca2 . conversely , the majority of families with male and female breast cancer were due to brca2 ( 76 % ) . the largest proportion ( 67 % ) of families due to other genes was found in families with four or five cases of female breast cancer only . these estimates were not substantially affected either by changing the assumed penetrance model for brca1 or by including or excluding brca1 mutation data . among those families with disease due to brca1 that were tested by one of the standard screening methods , mutations were detected in the coding sequence or splice sites in an estimated 63 % ( 95 % ci 51 % -77 % ) . the estimated sensitivity was identical for direct sequencing and other techniques . the penetrance of brca2 was estimated by maximizing the lod score in brca2-mutation families , over all possible penetrance functions . the estimated cumulative risk of breast cancer reached 28 % ( 95 % ci 9 % -44 % ) by age 50 years and 84 % ( 95 % ci 43 % -95 % ) by age 70 years . the corresponding ovarian cancer risks were 0 . 4 % ( 95 % ci 0 % -1 % ) by age 50 years and 27 % ( 95 % ci 0 % -47 % ) by age 70 years . the lifetime risk of breast cancer appears similar to the risk in brca1 carriers , but there was some suggestion of a lower risk in brca2 carriers < 50 years of age .;0;0;0;1

behavioral and neurochemical studies in mice pretreated with garcinielliptone fc in pilocarpine-induced seizures.;garcinielliptone fc (gfc) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species platonia insignis mart. it is widely used in folk medicine to treat skin diseases in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat diarrheas and inflammatory diseases. however, there is no research on gfc effects in the central nervous system of rodents. the present study aimed to evaluate the gfc effects at doses of 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid (r-aminobutyric acid (gaba), glutamine, aspartate and glutathione) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase (ache) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures. gfc produced an increased latency to first seizure, at doses 25mg/kg (20.12 + 2.20 min), 50mg/kg (20.95 + 2.21 min) or 75 mg/kg (23.43 + 1.99 min) when compared with seized mice. in addition, gaba content of mice hippocampus treated with gfc75 plus p400 showed an increase of 46.90% when compared with seized mice. in aspartate, glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5.21%, 13.55% and 21.80%, respectively in mice hippocampus treated with gfc75 plus p400 when compared with seized mice. hippocampus mice treated with gfc75 plus p400 showed an increase in ache activity (63.30%) when compared with seized mice. the results indicate that gfc can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals. in conclusion, our data suggest that gfc may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the gaba and glutamate contents and of ache activity in seized mice hippocampus. this compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent.;0;0;1;0

anti-oxidant effects of atorvastatin in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat.;1. dexamethasone (dex)-induced hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with nitric oxide (no) deficiency and increased superoxide (o2-) production. atorvastatin (ato) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of no and reduced o2- production in various forms of hypertension. in the present study, we investigated whether 50 mg/kg per day, p.o., ato could prevent endothelial no synthase (enos) downregulation and the increase in o2- in sprague-dawley (sd) rats, thereby reducing blood pressure. 2. male sd rats (n = 30) were treated with ato (50 mg/kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days. dexamethasone (10 microg/kg per day, s.c.) or saline was started after 4 days in ato-treated and non-treated rats and continued for 11-13 days. systolic blood pressure (sbp) was measured on alternate days using the tail-cuff method. endothelial function was assessed by acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments. vascular enos mrna was assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 3. in rats treated with dex alone, sbp was increased from 109 +/- 2 to 133 +/- 2 mmhg on days 4 and day 14, respectively (p < 0.001). in the ato + dex group, sbp was increased from 113 +/- 2 to 119 +/- 2 mmhg on days 4 to 14, respectively (p < 0.001), but was significantly lower than sbp in the group treated with dex alone (p < 0.05). endothelial-dependent relaxation and enos mrna expression were greater in the dex + ato group than in the dex only group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001, respectively). aortic superoxide production was lower in the dex + ato group compared with the group treated with dex alone (p < 0.0001). 4. treatment with ato improved endothelial function, reduced superoxide production and reduced sbp in dex-treated sd rats.;1;0;1;0

evidence for a selective brain noradrenergic involvement in the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine in the rat.;male rats received the noradrenaline neurotoxin dsp4 (50 mg/kg) 7 days prior to injection of d-amphetamine (10 or 40 mumol/kg i.p.). the hyperactivity induced by d-amphetamine (10 mumol/kg) was significantly reduced by dsp4 pretreatment. however, the increased rearings and the amphetamine-induced stereotypies were not blocked by pretreatment with dsp4. the reduction of amphetamine hyperactivity induced by dsp4 was blocked by pretreatment with the noradrenaline-uptake blocking agent, desipramine, which prevents the neurotoxic action of dsp4. the present results suggest a selective involvement of central noradrenergic neurones in the locomotor stimulant effect of amphetamine in the rat.;0;1;1;0

experimental cranial pain elicited by capsaicin: a pet study.;using a positron emission tomography (pet) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state, but not in the headache free interval. it was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called 'migraine generator'. to test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the pet scanner as in the migraine patients. a small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rcbf) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum. using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state. the increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache.;0;0;1;0
a pyridoxine-dependent behavioral disorder unmasked by isoniazid.;a 3-year-old girl had behavioral deterioration, with hyperkinesis, irritability, and sleeping difficulties after the therapeutic administration of isoniazid. the administration of pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine hydrochloride led to a disappearance of symptoms. after discontinuing isoniazid therapy a similar pattern of behavior was noted that was controlled by pyridoxine. a placebo had no effect, but niacinamide was as effective as pyridoxine. periodic withdrawal of pyridoxine was associated with return of the hyperkinesis. the level of pyridoxal in the blood was normal during the periods of relapse. metabolic studies suggested a block in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. the patient has been followed for six years and has required pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine to control her behavior.;0;0;1;0

structural analysis of the 5' region of mouse and human huntington disease genes reveals conservation of putative promoter region and di- and trinucleotide polymorphisms.;we have previously cloned and characterized the murine homologue of the huntington disease ( hd ) gene and shown that it maps to mouse chromosome 5 within a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 4p16 . 3 3 . here we present a detailed comparison of the sequence of the putative promoter and the organization of the 5 genomic region of the murine ( hdh ) and human hd genes encompassing the first five exons . we show that in this region these two genes share identical exon boundaries , but have different-size introns . two dinucleotide ( ct ) and one trinucleotide intronic polymorphism in hdh and an intronic ca polymorphism in the hd gene were identified . comparison of 940-bp sequence 5 to the putative translation start site reveals a highly conserved region ( 78 . 8 % nucleotide identity ) between hdh and the hd gene from nucleotide -56 to -206 ( of hdh ) . neither hdh nor the hd gene have typical tata or ccaat elements , but both show one putative ap2 binding site and numerous potential sp1 binding sites . the high sequence identity between hdh and the hd gene for approximately 200 bp 5 to the putative translation start site indicates that these sequences may play a role in regulating expression of the huntington disease gene;0;0;1;0

causes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy in patients receiving kidney transplantation.;objectives: thrombotic microangiopathy is a well-known problem in patients following renal transplantation. in postrenal transplantation, thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome. we aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature. materials and methods: we investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1-year period, from june 2003 to june 2004, at the king fahad national guard hospital in riyadh, saudi arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval. pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible. results: five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found. three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at king fahad national guard hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up. three cases were related to cyclosporine, and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus. the fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. conclusions: in the literature, the most-frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. other causes include drug-related (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) toxicity, procoagulant status, and antibody-mediated rejection. we found that the most-frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related, secondary mainly to cyclosporine. in the current study, the frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy was similar to the percentage reported in the literature (20%).;0;1;0;0
effect of humoral modulators of morphine-induced increase in locomotor activity of mice.;the effect of humoral modulators on the morphine-induced increase in locomotor activity of mice was studied. the subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg of morphine-hc1 produced a marked increase in locomotor activity in mice. the morphine-induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine. in contrast, both methscopolamine and neostigmine, which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine. pretreatment of mice with alpha-methyltyrosine (20 mg/kg i.p., one hour), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, significantly decreased the activity-increasing effects of morphine. on the other hand, pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalamine (3 x 320 mg/kg i.p., 24 hr), a serotonin depletor, caused no significant change in the hyperactivity. the study suggests that the activity-increasing effects of morphine are mediated by the release of catecholamines from adrenergic neurons in the brain. and the results are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine acts by retarding the release of acetylcholine at some central cholinergic synapses. it is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity-increasing effects of morphine in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity-increasing effects of morphine in rats.;0;0;1;0
pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to cpap during nitroprusside-induced hypotension.;the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt (qs/qt) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40-50 per cent. before nitroprusside infusion, 5 cm h2o cpap significantly, p less than .05, decreased arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly alter heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or qs/qt. ten cm h2o cpap before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and qs/qt. nitroprusside caused significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate, but did not change cardiac output or qs/qt. five cm h2o cpap during nitroprusside did not further alter any of the above-mentioned variables. however, 10 cm h2o cpap decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and qs/qt. these data indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 per cent do not change cardiac output or qs/qt. during nitroprusside infusion low levels of cpap do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics, but high levels of cpap (10 cm h2o), while decreasing qs/qt, produce marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.;1;0;0;0

effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium-induced chronic renal failure in rats.;rats with lithium-induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein (hp) feeding, uninephrectomy (nx) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure. newborn female wistar rats were fed a lithium-containing diet (50 mmol/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, hp diet (40 vs. 19%), nx or hp+nx for another 8 weeks. corresponding non-lithium pretreated groups were generated. when comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (gfr) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional li excretion. lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis. hp failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase gfr and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats. nx caused an additive deterioration in gfr which, however, was ameliorated by hp. nx+hp caused a further rise in blood pressure in li-pretreated rats. the results indicate that li-induced nephropathy, even when the gfr is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension. in this model of chronic renal failure the decline in gfr is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli. the fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced, leaving the distal delivery unchanged.(abstract truncated at 250 words);1;1;0;0

delayed institution of hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia: effect on brain edema.;the effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2-h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studied. under isoflurane anesthesia, the mca of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded. in the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (map) was not manipulated. in the hypertensive group (n = 7), the map was elevated by 25-30 mm hg beginning 2 h after mcao. four hours after mcao, the rats were killed and the brains harvested. the brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by mcao. specific gravity (sg) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the ischemic territory). the extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining. in the ischemic core, there was no difference in sg in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups. in the periphery of the ischemic territory, sg in the cortex was greater (less edema accumulation) in the hypertensive group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, p less than 0.05). the area of histochemical injury (as a percent of the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the hypertensive group (33 +/- 3% vs 21 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05). the data indicate that phenylephrine-induced hypertension instituted 2 h after mcao does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core, that it improves edema in the periphery of the ischemic territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction.;1;0;1;0

an investigation of the pattern of kidney injury in hiv-positive persons exposed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: an examination of a large population database (mhra database).;the potential for tenofovir to cause a range of kidney syndromes has been established from mechanistic and randomised clinical trials. however, the exact pattern of kidney involvement is still uncertain. we undertook a descriptive analysis of yellow card records of 407 hiv-positive persons taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tdf) as part of their antiretroviral therapy regimen and submitted to the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) with suspected kidney adverse effects. reports that satisfy defined criteria were classified as acute kidney injury, kidney tubular dysfunction and fanconi syndrome. of the 407 yellow card records analysed, 106 satisfied criteria for tdf-related kidney disease, of which 53 (50%) had features of kidney tubular dysfunction, 35 (33%) were found to have features of glomerular dysfunction and 18 (17%) had fanconi syndrome. the median tdf exposure was 316 days (interquartile range 120-740). the incidence of hospitalisation for tdf kidney adverse effects was high, particularly amongst patients with features of fanconi syndrome. the pattern of kidney syndromes in this population series mirrors that reported in randomised clinical trials. cessation of tdf was associated with complete restoration of kidney function in up half of the patients in this report.;0;1;0;0
effect of alkylxanthines on gentamicin-induced acute renal failure in the rat.;adenosine antagonists have been previously shown to be of benefit in some ischaemic and nephrotoxic models of acute renal failure (arf). in the present study, the effects of three alkylxanthines with different potencies as adenosine antagonists 8-phenyltheophylline, theophylline and enprofylline, were examined in rats developing acute renal failure after 4 daily injections of gentamicin (200 mg kg-1). renal function was assessed by biochemical (plasma urea and creatinine), functional (urine analysis and [3h]inulin and [14c]p-aminohippuric acid clearances) and morphological (degree of necrosis) indices. the various drug treatments produced improvements in some, but not all, measurements of renal function. however, any improvement produced by drug treatment was largely a result of a beneficial effect exerted by its vehicle (polyethylene glycol and naoh). the lack of any consistent protective effect noted with the alkylxanthines tested in the present study indicates that adenosine plays little, if any, pathophysiological role in gentamicin-induced arf.;0;1;0;0

effect of direct intracoronary administration of methylergonovine in patients with and without variant angina.;the effects of intracoronary administration of methylergonovine were studied in 21 patients with variant angina and 22 patients with atypical chest pain and in others without angina pectoris (control group). methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms/min up to 50 micrograms. in all patients with variant angina, coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 +/- 13 micrograms (mean +/- sd). in the control group neither ischemic st change nor localized spasm occurred. the basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery. the percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery. these results suggest that spasm provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine, have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries.;1;0;1;0

the tumor suppressor gene brca1 is required for embryonic cellular proliferation in the mouse.;mutations of the brca1 gone in humans are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers . we show here that brca1 + / - mice are normal and fertile and lack tumors by age eleven months . homozygous brca1 ( 5-6 ) mutant mice die before day 7 . 5 of embryogenesis . mutant embryos are poorly developed , with no evidence of mesoderm formation . the extraembryonic region is abnormal , but aggregation with wild-type tetraploid embryos does not rescue the lethality . in vivo , mutant embryos do not exhibit increased apoptosis but show reduced cell proliferation accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin e and mdm-2 , a regulator of p53 activity . the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is dramatically increased in the mutant embryos . buttressing these in vivo observations is the fact that mutant blastocyst growth is grossly impaired in vitro . thus , the death of brca1 ( 5-6 ) mutant embryos prior to gastrulation may be due to a failure of the proliferative burst required for the development of the different germ layers .;0;0;0;1
differential impact of immune escape mutations g145r and p120t on the replication of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis b virus e antigen-positive and -negative strains.;immune escape variants of the hepatitis b virus (hbv) represent an emerging clinical challenge, because they can be associated with vaccine escape, hbv reactivation, and failure of diagnostic tests. recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals. we therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sg145r and sp120t mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine (lam) and/or hbeag negativity. replication-competent hbv strains with sg145r or sp120t and lam resistance (rtm204i or rtl180m/rtm204v) were generated on an hbeag-positive and an hbeag-negative background with precore (pc) and basal core promoter (bcp) mutants. the sg145r mutation strongly reduced hbsag levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of lam-resistant hbv mutants to the levels of wild-type hbv, and pc or bcp mutations further enhanced viral replication. although the sp120t substitution also impaired hbsag secretion, it did not enhance the replication of lam-resistant clones. however, the concomitant occurrence of hbeag negativity (pc/bcp), sp120t, and lam resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type hbv. in all clones with combined immune escape and lam resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro. these findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex hbv mutants, supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns.;0;1;0;0
glycerol as a correlate of impaired glucose tolerance: dissection of a complex system by use of a simple genetic trait.;glycerol kinase ( gk ) represents the primary entry of glycerol into glucose and triglyceride metabolism . impaired glucose tolerance ( igt ) and hypertriglyceridemia are associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease . the relationship between glycerol and the risk of igt , however , is poorly understood . we therefore undertook the study of fasting plasma glycerol levels in a cohort of 1 , 056 unrelated men and women of french-canadian descent . family screening in the initial cohort identified 18 men from five families with severe hyperglycerolemia ( values above 2 . 0 mmol / liter ) and demonstrated an x-linked pattern of inheritance . linkage analysis of the data from 12 microsatellite markers surrounding the xp21 . 3 gk gene resulted in a peak lod score of 3 . 46 , centered around marker dxs8039 . in addition , since all of the families originated in a population with a proven founder effect-the saguenay lac-st . -jean region of quebec-a common disease haplotype was sought . indeed , a six-marker haplotype extending over a region of 5 . 5 cm was observed in all families . resequencing of the gk gene in family members led to the discovery of a n288d missense mutation in exon 10 , which resulted in the substitution of a highly conserved asparagine residue by a negatively charged aspartic acid .;1;0;0;0

simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation.;abstract serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy. however, hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin-ezetimibe. we describe a 70-year-old hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg/day to simvastatin 10 mg-ezetimibe 40 mg/day. the patient's lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity. a routine laboratory work-up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels. simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram (which she was taking for depression) were discontinued, and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded. a repeat work-up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels, and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate-to-severe drug toxicity. she underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course. her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23, and her 2-year follow-up showed no adverse events. ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases (ugt) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid, resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity. to our knowledge, this is the first case report of simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation. we postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe-induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of ugt enzymes. clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity with simvastatin-ezetimibe especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage.;0;1;0;0

anticonvulsant effect of eslicarbazepine acetate (bia 2-093) on seizures induced by microperfusion of picrotoxin in the hippocampus of freely moving rats.;eslicarbazepine acetate (bia 2-093, s-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide) is a novel antiepileptic drug, now in phase iii clinical trials, designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety in comparison with the structurally related drugs carbamazepine (cbz) and oxcarbazepine (oxc). we have studied the effects of oral treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate on a whole-animal model in which partial seizures can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or seizure patterns. in the animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin, the average number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2, and average seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4s. pre-treatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2h before picrotoxin microperfusion prevented seizures in the 75% of the rats. lower doses (3 and 10mg/kg) did not suppress seizures, however, after administration of 10mg/kg, significant reductions in seizures duration (24.3+/-6.8s) and seizure number (1.6+/-0.34) were found. no adverse effects of eslicarbazepine acetate were observed in the behavioral/eeg patterns studied, including sleep/wakefulness cycle, at the doses studied.;0;0;1;0
hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels, prolactin signaling, and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol.;hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido. although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood. we first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile lh secretion and the estrogen-induced lh surge. chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction lh pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol. sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid-induced lh surge or the percentage of gnrh neurons activated during the surge. estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors (prl-r) and components of prolactin's signaling pathway. to test the hypothesis that estrogen increases prl-r expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin-induced stat5 activation. lastly, we measured prl-r and suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs-1 and -3 and cis, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mrnas in response to sulpiride and estradiol. sulpiride induced only socs-1 in the medial preoptic area, where gnrh neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, prl-r, socs-3, and cis mrna levels were also induced. estradiol enhanced these effects on socs-3 and cis. interestingly, estradiol also induced prl-r, socs-3, and cis mrna levels independently. these data show that gnrh pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid-dependent manner. they also provide evidence for estradiol-dependent and brain region-specific regulation of prl-r expression and signaling responses by prolactin.;0;0;1;0
familial deficiency of the seventh component of complement associated with recurrent bacteremic infections due to neisseria .;the serum of a 29-year old woman with a recent episode of disseminated gonococcal infection and a history of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis as a child was found to lack serum hemolytic complement activity . the seventh component of complement ( c7 ) was not detected by functional or immunochemical assays , whereas other components were normal by hemolytic and immunochemical assessment . her fresh serum lacked complement-mediated bactericidal activity against neisseria gonorrhoeae , but the addition of fresh normal serum or purified c7 restored bactericidal activity as well as hemolytic activity . the absence of functional c7 activity could not be accounted for on the basis of an inhibitor . opsonization and generation of chemotactic activity functioned normally . complete absence of c7 was also found in one sibling who had the clinical syndrome of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis  as a child and in this siblings clinically well eight-year-old son . hla histocompatibility typing of the family members did not demonstrate evidence for genetic linkage of c7 deficiency with the major histocompatibility loci . this report represents the first cases of c7 deficiency associated with infectious complications and suggests that bactericidal activity may be important in host defense against bacteremic neisseria infections .;1;0;1;0

down-regulation of transmembrane carbonic anhydrases in renal cell carcinoma cell lines by wild-type von hippel-lindau transgenes.;to discover genes involved in von hippel-lindau ( vhl ) -mediated carcinogenesis , we used renal cell carcinoma cell lines stably transfected with wild-type vhl-expressing transgenes . large-scale rna differential display technology applied to these cell lines identified several differentially expressed genes , including an alpha carbonic anhydrase gene , termed ca12 . the deduced protein sequence was classified as a one-pass transmembrane ca possessing an apparently intact catalytic domain in the extracellular ca module . reintroduced wild-type vhl strongly inhibited the overexpression of the ca12 gene in the parental renal cell carcinoma cell lines . similar results were obtained with ca9 , encoding another transmembrane ca with an intact catalytic domain . although both domains of the vhl protein contribute to regulation of ca12 expression , the elongin binding domain alone could effectively regulate ca9 expression . we mapped ca12 and ca9 loci to chromosome bands 15q22 and 17q21 . 2 respectively , regions prone to amplification in some human cancers . additional experiments are needed to define the role of ca ix and ca xii enzymes in the regulation of ph in the extracellular microenvironment and its potential impact on cancer cell growth .;0;1;0;1

central action of narcotic analgesics. part iv. noradrenergic influences on the activity of analgesics in rats.;the effect of clonidine, naphazoline and xylometazoline on analgesia induced by morphine, codeine, fentanyl and pentazocine, and on cataleptic effect of morphine, codine and fentanyl was studied in rats. the biochemical assays on the influence of four analgesics on the brain concentration and turnover of noradrenaline (na) were also performed. it was found that three drugs stimulating central na receptors failed to affect the analgesic ed50 of all antinociceptive agents and they enhanced catalepsy induced by morphine and fentanyl. codeine catalepsy was increased by clonidine and decreased by naphazoline and xylometazoline. the brain concentration of na was not changed by morphine and fentanyl, but one of the doses of codeine (45 mg/kg) slightly enhanced it. pentazocine dose-dependently decreased the brain level of na. the rate of na turnover was not altered by analgesics except for the higher dose of fentanyl (0.2 mg/kg) following which the disappearance of na from the brain was diminished. the results are discussed in the light of various and non-uniform data from the literature. it is suggested that in rats the brain na plays a less important function than the other monoamines in the behavioural activity of potent analgesics.;0;1;1;0

exon-intron structure of the human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit (chrna4).;the human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit gene ( chrna4 ) is located in the candidate region for three different phenotypes  benign familial neonatal convulsions , autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy , and low-voltage eeg . recently , a missense mutation in transmembrane domain 2 of chrna4 was found to be associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy in one extended pedigree . we have determined the genomic organization of chrna4 , which consists of six exons distributed over approximately 17 kb of genomic dna . the nucleotide sequence obtained from the genomic regions adjacent to the exon boundaries enabled us to develop a set of primer pairs for pcr amplification of the complete coding region . the sequence analysis provides the basis for a comprehensive mutation screening of chrna4 in the above-mentioned phenotypes and possibly in other types of idiopathic epilepsies . .;0;0;1;0
the red-green visual pigment gene region in adrenoleukodystrophy.;"although recent data established that a specific very-long-chain fatty acyl-coa synthetase is defective in x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) , the ald gene is still unidentified . the ald locus has been mapped to xq28 , like the red and green color pigment genes . abnormal color vision has been observed in 12 of 27 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy ( amn ) , a milder form of ald . furthermore , rearrangements of the color vision gene cluster were found in four of eight ald kindreds . this led us to propose that a single dna rearrangement could underlie both ald and abnormal color vision in these patients . study of 34 french ald patients failed to reveal a higher than expected frequency of green / red visual pigment rearrangements 3 to the red / green color vision gene complex . the previous report of such rearrangements was based on small numbers and lack of knowledge that the frequency of "" abnormal "" color vision arrays on molecular analysis was twice as high as expected on the basis of the frequency of phenotypic color vision defects . the red / green color pigment ( r / gcp ) region was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 14 of these patients , and we did not find any fragment size difference between the patients and normal individuals who have the same number of pigment genes . the r / gcp region was also analyzed in 29 french and seven north american ald patients by using six genomic dna probes , isolated from a cosmid walk , that flank the color vision genes . no deletions were found with probes that lie 3 of the green pigment genes . one of the eight previously reported ald individuals has a long deletion 5 of the red pigment gene , a deletion causing blue cone monochromacy . this finding and the previous findings of a 45 % frequency of phenotypic color vision defects in patients with amn may suggest that the ald / amn gene lies 5 to the red pigment gene and that the frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe their origin to deleted dna that includes regulatory genes for color vision . it is possible , however , that phenotypic color vision anomalies in amn may be phenocopies secondary to retinal or neural involvement by the disease . the single case of blue cone monochromacy may therefore be a fortuitous coincidence of two diseases . .";0;0;1;0

crescentic fibrillary glomerulonephritis associated with intermittent rifampin therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis.;this case study reveals an unusual finding of rapidly proliferative crescentic glomerulonephritis in a patient treated with rifampin who had no other identifiable causes for developing this disease. this patient underwent a 10-month regimen of rifampin and isoniazid for pulmonary tuberculosis and was discovered to have developed signs of severe renal failure five weeks after completion of therapy. renal biopsy revealed severe glomerulonephritis with crescents, electron dense fibrillar deposits and moderate lymphocytic interstitial infiltrate. other possible causes of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis were investigated and ruled out. this report documents the unusual occurrence of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescents and fibrillar glomerulonephritis in a patient treated with rifampin.;0;1;0;0
the dose-dependent effect of misoprostol on indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction in well compensated cirrhosis.;misoprostol (200 micrograms) has been shown to acutely counteract the indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction in well compensated cirrhotic patients. the aim of this study was to determine if the prophylactic value of misoprostol was dose-dependent. parameters of renal hemodynamics and tubular sodium and water handling were assessed by clearance techniques in 26 well compensated cirrhotic patients before and after an oral combination of 50 mg of indomethacin and various doses of misoprostol. the 200-micrograms dose was able to totally abolish the deleterious renal effects of indomethacin, whereas the 800-micrograms dose resulted in significant worsening of renal hemodynamics and sodium retention. these changes were maximal in the hour immediately after medications and slowly returned toward base-line levels thereafter. these results suggest that the renal protective effects of misoprostol is dose-dependent. however, until this apparent ability of 200 micrograms of misoprostol to prevent the adverse effects of indomethacin on renal function is confirmed with chronic frequent dosing, it would be prudent to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with cirrhosis.;0;1;1;0

deficiency of the fifth component of complement in human subjects.;clinical, genetic and immunologic studies in a large kindred. the discovery of a large kindred with a heritable deficiency of the fifth component of complement ( c5 ) has permitted the accumulation of new clinical , genetic and immunologic data concerning the role of c5 in human subjects . the proband , who has had nine episodes of disseminated gonococcal infection , has a hemolytic c5 level of approximately 0 . 5 per cent of normal . no c5 protein was detectable , but low levels of functional c5 activity could be found using a sensitive bactericidal assay . the probands twin as well as another sister also had extremely low levels of hemolytic c5 ( approximately 0 . 5 per cent normal ) , but both these subjects have been healthy . hemolytic complement and bacteriolytic activity could be restored by the addition of purified c5 . no chemotactic activity for polymorphonuclear leukocytes could be generated in the c5-deficient serums upon activation of either the classic or alternative pathways , again demonstrating the importance of c5 in human subjects for the production of chemotactic factors . the chemotactic responsiveness of the patients polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes to preformed chemotactic factors was not depressed . twenty-two of 32 other family members from three generations had depressed whole hemolytic complement levels . in 19 of 30 family members , levels of hemolytic c5 ranged from 13 to 64 per cent of normal . no linkage for c5 deficiency and the a or b loci of the major histocompatibility complex could be found . these data suggest an autosomal codominant mode of inheritance of c5 deficiency . deficiency of c5 is compatible with good health , but it can be associated with repeated disseminated gonococcal infection;0;0;1;0

a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-comparison trial of haloperidol for psychosis and disruptive behaviors in alzheimer's disease.;objective: the goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with alzheimer's disease. method: in a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase a), haloperidol, 2-3 mg/day (standard dose), and haloperidol, 0.50-0.75 mg/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with alzheimer's disease. for the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase b), patients taking standard- or low-dose haloperidol were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose haloperidol. results: for the 60 patients who completed phase a, standard-dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low-dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the brief psychiatric rating scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation. response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%). the advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase b. in phase a, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs. low-dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects. conclusions: the results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2-3 mg/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs. a starting dose of 1 mg/day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended. the narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in alzheimer's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors.;0;0;1;0
microdeletions at chromosome bands 1q32-q41 as a cause of van der woude syndrome.;van der woude syndrome ( vws ) is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising cleft lip and / or cleft palate and lip pits . we reported previously a family whose underlying mutation is a 500-800 kb deletion localized to chromosome bands 1q32-q41 [ sander et al . , 1994  hum mol genet 3  576-578 ] . along with cleft lip / palate and lip pits , affected relatives exhibit developmental delays , suggesting that the function of a gene nearby may also be disrupted . to further localize the vws gene we searched for other deletions that cause vws . an allele loss assay was performed using a novel highly polymorphic marker , d1s3753 . from a panel of 37 unrelated individuals , we detected an allele loss in one family , indicating the presence of a deletion . in this family , the phenotype in three generations of affected individuals was confined to the cardinal signs of vws . surprisingly , mapping of the new deletion showed that it extended 0 . 2-1 mb beyond the proximal breakpoint for the deletion described previously . no deletions were detected in seven cases of popliteal pterygia syndrome , 76 cases of mixed syndromic forms of cleft lip and palate , and 178 cases of nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate .;0;0;1;0

sulfasalazine-induced lupus erythematosus.;pneumonitis, bilateral pleural effusions, echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade, and positive autoantibodies developed in a 43-year-old man, who was receiving long-term sulfasalazine therapy for chronic ulcerative colitis. after cessation of the sulfasalazine and completion of a six-week course of corticosteroids, these problems resolved over a period of four to six months. it is suggested that the patient had sulfasalazine-induced lupus, which manifested with serositis and pulmonary parenchymal involvement in the absence of joint symptoms. physicians who use sulfasalazine to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease should be aware of the signs of sulfasalazine-induced lupus syndrome.;1;0;1;0
the alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits are necessary for nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in mice.;binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) elicits a series of dose-dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration, sedation, and tremors, to seizures and death. nachrs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits. a gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors. we examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures. using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mrna levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mrna levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to nicotine-induced seizures when compared to wild-type littermates. mrna levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains. together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion.;0;0;1;0

amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.;amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side-effects, the most problematic being pneumonitis. the pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and t cell-mediated hypersensitivity pneumonitis. the clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity are characteristic but nonspecific. the diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities, such as heart failure, infection, and malignancy. while withdrawal of amiodarone leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases, this is not always possible or advisable. dose reduction or concomitant steroid therapy may have a role in selected patients.;1;0;0;0
reduction of heparan sulphate-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.;heparan sulphate-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin and in age- adn sex-matched control rats, employing the cationic dye cuprolinic blue. morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor. the heparan sulphate specificity of the cuprolinic blue staining was demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining, whereas chondroitinase abc had no effect. the majority of anionic sites (74% in diabetic and 81% in control rats) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane. a minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna, and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane (p<0.001 and p<0.01 for diabetic and control rats, respectively). diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40.3 (32.2-62.0) mg/24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals (0.8 (0.2-0.9) mg/24 h, p<0.002). at the same time, the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface (number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% (p<0.021) and by 26% (p<0.02), respectively. number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane (lamina densa and lamina rara interna) were not significantly changed. we conclude that in streptozotocin-diabetic rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion, a reduced heparan sulphate charge barrier/density is found at the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane.;0;1;0;0

the 185delag brca1 mutation originated before the dispersion of jews in the diaspora and is not limited to ashkenazim.;the 185delag mutation in brca1 is detected in ashkenazi jews both in familial breast and ovarian cancer and in the general population . all tested ashkenazi mutation carriers share the same allelic pattern at the brca1 locus . our previous study showed that this ashkenazi mutation also occurs in iraqi jews with a similar allelic pattern . we extended our analysis to other non-ashkenazi subsets  354 of moroccan origin , 200 yemenites and 150 iranian jews . heteroduplex analysis complemented by direct dna sequencing of abnormally migrating bands were employed . four of moroccan origin ( 1 . 1 % ) and none of the yemenites or iranians was a carrier of the 185delag mutation . brca1 allelic patterns were determined for four of these individuals and for 12 additional non-ashkenazi 185delag mutation carriers who had breast / ovarian cancer . six non-ashkenazi individuals shared the common ashkenazi haplotype , four had a closely related pattern , and the rest ( n = 6 ) displayed a distinct brca1 allelic pattern . we conclude that the 185delag brca1 mutation occurs in some non-ashkenazi populations at rates comparable with that of ashkenazim . the majority of jewish 185delag mutation carriers have a common allelic pattern , supporting the founder effect notion , but dating the mutations origin to an earlier date than currently estimated . however , the different allelic pattern at the brca1 locus even in some jewish mutation carriers , might suggest that the mutation arose independently . .;0;0;0;1
atm phosphorylates p95/nbs1 in an s-phase checkpoint pathway.;the rare diseases ataxia-telangiectasia ( at ) , caused by mutations in the atm gene , and nijmegen breakage syndrome ( nbs ) , with mutations in the p95 / nbs1 gene , share a variety of phenotypic abnormalities such as chromosomal instability , radiation sensitivity and defects in cell-cycle checkpoints in response to ionizing radiation . the atm gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs , whereas p95 / nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to dna double-strand breaks . here , because of the similarities between at and nbs , we evaluated the functional interactions between atm and p95 / nbs1 . activation of the atm kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of atm-dependent responses in nbs cells indicated that p95 / nbs1 may not be required for signalling to atm after ionizing radiation . however , p95 / nbs1 was phosphorylated on serine 343 in an atm-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation . a p95 / nbs1 construct mutated at the atm phosphorylation site abrogated an s-phase checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation in normal cells and failed to compensate for this functional deficiency in nbs cells . these observations link atm and p95 / nbs1 in a common signalling pathway and provide an explanation for phenotypic similarities in these two diseases . .;0;0;1;0

long-term follow-up of ifosfamide renal toxicity in children treated for malignant mesenchymal tumors: an international society of pediatric oncology report.;"the renal function of 74 children with malignant mesenchymal tumors in complete remission and who have received the same ifosfamide chemotherapy protocol (international society of pediatric oncology malignant mesenchymal tumor study 84 [siop mmt 84]) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment. total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide (six or 10 cycles of ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin [iva]). none of them had received cisplatin chemotherapy. ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years; 58 patients were males and 42 females. the most common primary tumor site was the head and neck. renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes, glucosuria, proteinuria, aminoaciduria, urinary ph, osmolarity, creatinine clearance, phosphate tubular reabsorption, beta 2 microglobulinuria, and lysozymuria. fifty-eight patients (78%) had normal renal tests, whereas 16 patients (22%) had renal abnormalities. two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group: the first included four patients (5% of the total population) who developed major toxicity resulting in fanconi's syndrome (tdfs); and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low phosphate reabsorption. the remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria. severe toxicity was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide, a younger age (less than 2 1/2 years old), and a predominance of vesicoprostatic tumor involvement. this low percentage (5%) of tdfs must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of ifosfamide in the treatment of mesenchymal tumors in children.";0;1;0;1
hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone reported with the use of vincristine: an over-representation of asians?;purpose: this retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company's global safety database to determine the reporting rate of hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (siadh) among vincristine-treated patients and to explore the possibility of at-risk population subgroups. method: we searched the eli lilly and company's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and/or siadh as of 1 november 1999 that had been reported during the use of vincristine. results: a total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and/or siadh associated with vincristine use were identified. the overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1.3/100,000 treated patients. the average age of patients was 35.6 +/- 28.3 years, and 62% were males. approximately 75% of the patients were receiving treatment for leukemia or lymphoma. among the 39 reports that included information on race, the racial distribution was: 1 black, 3 caucasian, and 35 asian. conclusion: our data suggest that asian patients may be at increased risk of hyponatremia and/or siadh associated with vincristine use. although the overall reported rate of siadh associated with vincristine is very low, physicians caring for asian oncology patients should be aware of this potential serious but reversible adverse event.;0;0;0;1
chronic treatment with metformin suppresses toll-like receptor 4 signaling and attenuates left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction.;acute treatment with metformin has a protective effect in myocardial infarction by suppression of inflammatory responses due to activation of amp-activated protein kinase (ampk). in the present study, the effect of chronic pre-treatment with metformin on cardiac dysfunction and toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) activities following myocardial infarction and their relation with ampk were assessed. male wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (n=6): normal control and groups were injected isoproterenol after chronic pre-treatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100mg/kg of metformin twice daily for 14 days. isoproterenol (100mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously on the 13th and 14th days to induce acute myocardial infarction. isoproterenol alone decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility indexed as lvdp/dtmax and lvdp/dtmin. the left ventricular dysfunction was significantly lower in the groups treated with 25 and 50mg/kg of metformin. metfromin markedly lowered isoproterenol-induced elevation in the levels of tlr4 mrna, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (myd88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-a), and interleukin 6 (il-6) in the heart tissues. similar changes were also seen in the serum levels of tnf-a and il-6. however, the lower doses of 25 and 50mg/kg were more effective than 100mg/kg. phosphorylated ampka (p-ampk) in the myocardium was significantly elevated by 25mg/kg of metformin, slightly by 50mg/kg, but not by 100mg/kg. chronic pre-treatment with metformin reduces post-myocardial infarction cardiac dysfunction and suppresses inflammatory responses, possibly through inhibition of tlr4 activities. this mechanism can be considered as a target to protect infarcted myocardium.;1;0;0;1

inherited colorectal polyposis and cancer risk of the apc i1307k polymorphism.;germ-line and somatic truncating mutations of the apc gene are thought to initiate colorectal tumor formation in familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis , respectively . recently , an isoleucine-- > lysine polymorphism at codon 1307 ( i1307k ) of the apc gene has been identified in 6 % -7 % of the ashkenazi jewish population . to assess the risk of this common apc allelic variant in colorectal carcinogenesis , we have analyzed a large cohort of unselected ashkenazi jewish subjects with adenomatous polyps and . or colorectal cancer , for the apc i1307k polymorphism . the apc i1307k allele was identified in 48 ( 10 . 1 % ) of 476 patients . compared with the frequency in two separate population control groups , the apc i1307k allele is associated with an estimated relative risk of 1 . 5-1 . 7 for colorectal neoplasia ( both p = . 01 ) . furthermore , compared with noncarriers , apc i1307k carriers had increased numbers of adenomas and colorectal cancers per patient ( p = . 03 ) , as well as a younger age at diagnosis . we conclude that the apc i1307k variant leads to increased adenoma formation and directly contributes to 3 % -4 % of all ashkenazi jewish colorectal cancer . the estimated relative risk for carriers may justify specific clinical screening for the 360 , 000 americans expected to harbor this allele , and genetic testing in the setting of long-term-outcome studies may impact significantly on colorectal cancer prevention in this population .;0;0;0;1

a large population-based follow-up study of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and cephalexin for uncommon serious drug toxicity.;"we conducted a population-based 45-day follow-up study of 232,390 people who were prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smz), 266,951 prescribed trimethoprim alone, and 196,397 prescribed cephalexin, to estimate the risk of serious liver, blood, skin, and renal disorders resulting in referral or hospitalization associated with these drugs. the results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the united kingdom, together with a review of clinical records. the risk of clinically important idiopathic liver disease was similar for persons prescribed tmp-smz (5.2/100,000) and those prescribed trimethoprim alone (3.8/100,000). the risk for those prescribed cephalexin was somewhat lower (2.0/100,000). only five patients experienced blood disorders, one of whom was exposed to tmp-smz; of seven with erythema multiforme and stevens-johnson syndrome, four were exposed to tmp-smz. the one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in a patient who took cephalexin. finally, only five cases of acute parenchymal renal disease occurred, none likely to be caused by a study drug. we conclude that the risk of the serious diseases studied is small for the three agents, and compares reasonably with the risk for many other antibiotics.";0;1;0;0

can angiogenesis be a target of treatment for ribavirin associated hemolytic anemia?;background/aims: recently ribavirin has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib have been found to cause acute hemolysis. we aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against anemia. methods: fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis c virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin. serum hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin-2 were investigated before and after therapy. results: we observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period. hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment. in contrast with the literature, serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy. we found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin. conclusion: this is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis c and we could not find any relation. future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of ribavirin therapy.;0;1;1;0
acute neurologic dysfunction after high-dose etoposide therapy for malignant glioma.;etoposide (vp-16-213) has been used in the treatment of many solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. when used in high doses and in conjunction with autologous bone marrow transplantation, this agent has activity against several treatment-resistant cancers including malignant glioma. in six of eight patients (75%) who we treated for recurrent or resistant glioma, sudden severe neurologic deterioration occurred. this developed a median of 9 days after initiation of high-dose etoposide therapy. significant clinical manifestations have included confusion, papilledema, somnolence, exacerbation of motor deficits, and sharp increase in seizure activity. these abnormalities resolved rapidly after initiation of high-dose intravenous dexamethasone therapy. in all patients, computerized tomographic (ct) brain scans demonstrated stability in tumor size and peritumor edema when compared with pretransplant scans. this complication appears to represent a significant new toxicity of high-dose etoposide therapy for malignant glioma.;0;0;1;1
effects of dehydroepiandrosterone in amphetamine-induced schizophrenia models in mice.;objective: to examine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) on animal models of schizophrenia. methods: seventy swiss albino female mice (25-35 g) were divided into 4 groups: amphetamine-free (control), amphetamine, 50, and 100 mg/kg dhea. the dhea was administered intraperitoneally (ip) for 5 days. amphetamine (3 mg/kg ip) induced hyper locomotion, apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously [sc]) induced climbing, and haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg sc) induced catalepsy tests were used as animal models of schizophrenia. the study was conducted at the animal experiment laboratories, department of pharmacology, medical school, eskisehir osmangazi university, eskisehir, turkey between march and may 2012. statistical analysis was carried out using kruskal-wallis test for hyper locomotion, and one-way anova for climbing and catalepsy tests. results: in the amphetamine-induced locomotion test, there were significant increases in all movements compared with the amphetamine-free group. both dhea 50 mg/kg (p<0.05), and 100 mg/kg (p<0.01) significantly decreased all movements compared with the amphetamine-induced locomotion group. there was a significant difference between groups in the haloperidol-induced catalepsy test (p<0.05). there was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the apomorphine-induced climbing test (p>0.05). conclusion: we observed that dhea reduced locomotor activity and increased catalepsy at both doses, while it had no effect on climbing behavior. we suggest that dhea displays typical neuroleptic-like effects, and may be used in the treatment of schizophrenia.;0;0;1;0

central nervous system toxicity following the administration of levobupivacaine for lumbar plexus block: a report of two cases.;background and objectives: central nervous system and cardiac toxicity following the administration of local anesthetics is a recognized complication of regional anesthesia. levobupivacaine, the pure s(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, was developed to improve the cardiac safety profile of bupivacaine. we describe 2 cases of grand mal seizures following accidental intravascular injection of levobupivacaine. case report: two patients presenting for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limb underwent blockade of the lumbar plexus via the posterior approach. immediately after the administration of levobupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 2.5 microgram/ml, the patients developed grand mal seizures, despite negative aspiration for blood and no clinical signs of intravenous epinephrine administration. the seizures were successfully treated with sodium thiopental in addition to succinylcholine in 1 patient. neither patient developed signs of cardiovascular toxicity. both patients were treated preoperatively with beta-adrenergic antagonist medications, which may have masked the cardiovascular signs of the unintentional intravascular administration of levobupivacaine with epinephrine. conclusions: although levobupivacaine may have a safer cardiac toxicity profile than racemic bupivacaine, if adequate amounts of levobupivacaine reach the circulation, it will result in convulsions. plasma concentrations sufficient to result in central nervous system toxicity did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity in these 2 patients.;1;0;1;0

anti-carcinogenic action of phenobarbital given simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine in the rat.;the present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of phenobarbital (pb: 15 mg per rat of ingested dose) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine (den: 10 mg/kg/day). wistar rats (180 g) were treated by den alone or by den + pb during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis. after the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced pas positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when pb was given simultaneously with den for 4 and 6 weeks. the mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in den treated rats were also significantly decreased in den + pb treated rats. when the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of pb did not change significantly the last parameters. in den + pb treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by den alone. it is concluded that pb, which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the den treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with den. this 'anti-carcinogen' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the precancerous lesions. biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this 'paradoxical' pb effect.;0;0;0;1

antioxidant effects of bovine lactoferrin on dexamethasone-induced hypertension in rat.;dexamethasone- (dex-) induced hypertension is associated with enhanced oxidative stress. lactoferrin (lf) is an iron-binding glycoprotein with antihypertensive properties. in this study, we investigated the effect of chronic administration of lf on oxidative stress and hypertension upon dex administration. male wistar rats were treated by dex (30  u g/kg/day subcutaneously) or saline for 14 days. oral bovine lf (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) was given from day 8 to 14 in a reversal study. in a prevention study, rats received 4 days of lf treatment followed by dex and continued during the test period. systolic blood pressure (sbp) was measured using tail-cuff method. thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity. plasma hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (frap) value were determined. dexamethasone significantly increased sbp and plasma h2o2 level and decreased thymus and body weights. lf lowered (p < 0.01) and dose dependently prevented (p < 0.001) dex-induced hypertension. lf prevented body weight loss and significantly reduced the elevated plasma h2o2 and increased frap values. chronic administration of lf strongly reduced the blood pressure and production of ros and improved antioxidant capacity in dex-induced hypertension, suggesting the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another mechanism of antihypertensive action of lf.;1;0;0;0

assessment of a new non-invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.;background: electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. objectives: to assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dp/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ecg, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using tc99m-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia. methods: the study group comprised 40 patients undergoing sestamibi-spect/dobutamine stress test. simultaneous measurements of ecg and brachial artery dp/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. in 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on spect. the increase in dp/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dp/dtejc outcome was combined with the ecg results, giving an ecg-enhanced value, and compared to ecg alone. results: the sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%. conclusions: if ecg alone is used for specificity, the combination with dp/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.;1;0;0;0

severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation caused by pomc mutations in humans.;"sequential cleavage of the precursor protein pre-pro-opiomelanocortin ( pomc ) generates the melanocortin peptides adrenocorticotrophin ( acth ) , melanocyte-stimulating hormones ( msh ) alpha , beta and gamma as well as the opioid-receptor ligand beta-endorphin . while a few cases of isolated acth deficiency have been reported ( omim 201400 ) , an inherited pomc defect has not been described so far . recent studies in animal models elucidated a central role of alpha-msh in the regulation of food intake by activation of the brain melanocortin-4-receptor ( mc4-r ; refs 3-5 ) and the linkage of human obesity to chromosome 2 in close proximity to the pomc locus , led to the proposal of an association of pomc with human obesity . the dual role of alpha-msh in regulating food intake and influencing hair pigmentation predicts that the phenotype associated with a defect in pomc function would include obesity , alteration in pigmentation and acth deficiency . the observation of these symptoms in two probands prompted us to search for mutations within their pomc genes . patient 1 was found to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in exon 3 ( g7013t , c7133delta ) which interfere with appropriate synthesis of acth and alpha-msh . patient 2 was homozygous for a mutation in exon 2 ( c3804a ) which abolishes pomc translation . these findings represent the first examples of a genetic defect within the pomc gene and define a new monogenic endocrine disorder resulting in early-onset obesity , adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation . .";0;1;1;0
testosterone-dependent hypertension and upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen in dahl salt-sensitive rats.;blood pressure (bp) is more salt sensitive in men than in premenopausal women. in dahl salt-sensitive rats (ds), high-salt (hs) diet increases bp more in males than females. in contrast to the systemic renin-angiotensin system, which is suppressed in response to hs in male ds, intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased, and intrarenal levels of ang ii are not suppressed. in this study, the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in hs-induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in bp and renal injury. on a low-salt (ls) diet, male ds had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mrna than females. hs diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mrna and protein only in male ds, which was prevented by castration. ovariectomy of female ds had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet. radiotelemetric bp was similar between males and castrated rats on ls diet. hs diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in bp, protein and albumin excretion, and glomerular sclerosis in male ds rats, which were attenuated by castration. testosterone replacement in castrated ds rats increased bp, renal injury, and upregulation of renal angiotensinogen associated with hs diet. testosterone contributes to the development of hypertension and renal injury in male ds rats on hs diet possibly through upregulation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.;1;1;0;0

non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-associated acute interstitial nephritis with granular tubular basement membrane deposits.;acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis (atin) is an important cause of acute renal failure resulting from a variety of insults, including immune complex-mediated tubulo-interstitial injury, but drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are a far more frequent cause. overall, as an entity, atin remains under-diagnosed, as symptoms resolve spontaneously if the medication is stopped. we report on a 14-year-old boy who developed acute renal failure 2 weeks after aortic valve surgery. he was put on aspirin following surgery and took ibuprofen for fever for nearly a week prior to presentation. he then presented to the emergency department feeling quite ill and was found to have a blood urea nitrogen (bun) concentration of of 147 mg/dl, creatinine of 15.3 mg/dl and serum potassium of 8.7 meq/l. dialysis was immediately initiated. a kidney biopsy showed inflammatory infiltrate consistent with atin. however, in the tubular basement membrane (tbm), very intense granular deposits of polyclonal igg and c3 were noted. he needed dialysis for 2 weeks and was treated successfully with steroids for 6 months. his renal recovery and disappearance of proteinuria took a year. in conclusion, this is a first report of nsaids-associated atin, showing deposits of granular immune complex present only in the tbm and not in the glomeruli.;1;1;1;0
novel inherited mutations and variable expressivity of brca1 alleles, including the founder mutation 185delag in ashkenazi jewish families.;thirty-seven families with four or more cases of breast cancer or breast and ovarian cancer were analyzed for mutations in brca1 . twelve different germ-line mutations , four novel and eight previously observed , were detected in 16 families . five families of ashkenazi jewish descent carried the 185delag mutation and shared the same haplotype at eight polymorphic markers spanning approximately 850 kb at brca1 . expressivity of 185delag in these families varied , from early-onset breast cancer without ovarian cancer . mutation 4184deltcaa occurred independently in two families . in one family , penetrance was complete , with females developing early-onset breast cancer or ovarian cancer and the male carrier developing prostatic cancer , whereas , in the other family , penetrance was incomplete and only breast cancer occurred , diagnosed at ages 38-81 years . two novel nonsense mutations led to the loss of mutant brca1 transcript in families with 10 and 6 cases of early-onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer . a 665-nt segment of the brca1 3-utr and 1 . 3 kb of genomic sequence including the putative promoter region were invariant by single-strand conformation analysis in 13 families without coding-sequence mutations . overall in our series , brca1 mutations have been detected in 26 families  16 with positive brca1 lod scores , 7 with negative lod scores ( reflecting multiple sporadic breast cancers ) , and 3 not tested for linkage . three other families have positive lod scores for linkage to brca2 , but 13 families without detected brca1 mutations have negative lod scores for both brca1 and brca2 .;0;0;0;1

22-oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal failure.;"background: calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (pth) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks, including hypercalcemia and/or marked suppression of bone turnover, which may lead to adynamic bone disease. a new vitamin d analogue, 22-oxacalcitriol (oct), has been shown to have promising characteristics. this study was undertaken to determine the effects of oct on serum pth levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function. methods: sixty dogs were either nephrectomized (nx, n = 38) or sham-operated (sham, n = 22). the animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance pth secretion. fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation, half of the nx and sham dogs received doses of oct (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks. thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months. biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after oct or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period. results: in nx dogs, oct significantly decreased serum pth levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency. in long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, oct (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum pth levels during the first months. serum pth levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in nx control. these effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. in animals with normal renal function, oct induced a transient decrease in serum pth levels at a dose of 0.1 microg/kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses. in nx dogs, oct reversed abnormal bone formation, such as woven osteoid and fibrosis, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover. in addition, oct improved mineralization lag time, (that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both nx and sham dogs. conclusions: these results indicate that even though oct does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease.";0;1;0;0
deficiency of the murine fifth complement component (c5) .;"a 2-base pair gene deletion in a 5'-exon. to ascertain the molecular mechanism that causes murine c5 deficiency , genomic and cdna libraries were constructed from mouse liver dna and mrna employing the congenic strains b10 . d2 / nsnj and b10 . d2 / osnj that are sufficient and deficient for c5 , respectively . genomic fragments were isolated which correspond to pvuii and hindiii restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with c5 deficiency . sequence analyses demonstrated that each of these polymorphisms resulted from single base pair substitutions and that neither substitution would probably cause or contribute to the c5 deficiency . sequence analyses of c5 sufficient and deficient cdnas revealed a 2 base-pair deletion in the deficient cdnas . the "" ta "" deletion was located near the 5 end of the cdna . this deletion shifts the reading frame of the c5 mrna so that the termination codon uga is present 4 base pairs downstream from the deletion . genomic dna was amplified and sequenced corresponding to the area surrounding the 2-base pair deletion . six c5-deficient strains , a / hej , akr / j , dba / 2j , nzb / b1nj , swr / j , and b10 . d2 / osnj , and four c5-sufficient strains , balb / cj , c57bl / 6j , dba / 1j , and b10 . d2 / nsnj , were analyzed . the sequencing data revealed that the 2 base pairs were deleted from the c5 gene of each deficient mouse tested but not from the c5 gene of any sufficient mouse . these data demonstrate that  1 ) there is an identical 2-base pair deletion in an exon of the c5 gene in several different c5-deficient mouse strains ; 2 ) the mrna transcribed from the c5d gene retains this deletion ; and 3 ) this mutation should result in c5 protein deficiency .";0;1;1;0

bradykinin receptors antagonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors in vincristine and streptozotocin induced hyperalgesia in chemotherapy and diabetic neuropathy rat model.;"purpose: the influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive no synthase (l-noarg; 1.0 mg/kg ip), a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible no synthase (l-nil; 1.0 mg/kg ip) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal no synthase (7-ni; 0.1 mg/kg ip), on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of b2 and b1 receptors: d-arg-[hyp3,thi5,d-tic7,oic8] bradykinin (hoe 140; 70 nmol/kg ip) or des arg10 hoe 140 (70 nmol/kg ip) respectively, in model of diabetic (streptozotocin-induced) and toxic (vincristine-induced) neuropathy was investigated. methods: the changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli--the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by randall-selitto. results: the results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible no synthase but not neuronal no synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia. pretreatment with l-noarg and l-nil but not 7-ni, significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both hoe 140 and des arg10 hoe 140. it was also shown that both products of inducible no synthase and neuronal no synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine. moreover, l-noarg and 7-ni but not l-nil intensify antihyperalgesic activity of hoe 140 or des-arg10hoe 140 in toxic neuropathy. conclusions: results of these studies suggest that b1 and b2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy. in streptozotocin-induced hyperalgesia, inducible no synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin, whereas in vincristine-induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal no synthase pathway. therefore, concomitant administration of small doses of bradykinin receptor antagonists and no synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of neuropathic pain, even in hospital care.";0;0;1;0

the hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery: findings in six cases.;"oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension, particularly when given as a bolus. the resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return. parturients with normal volume status, heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume. oxytocin-induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss. pulse power analysis (also called ""pulse contour analysis"") of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time, thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure. pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia. hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output. pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating hypotension during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia.";1;1;0;0

interaction of cyclosporin a with antineoplastic agents.;a synergistic effect of etoposide and cyclosporin a was observed in a patient with acute t-lymphocytic leukemia in relapse. the concomitant administration of etoposide and cyclosporin a resulted in eradication of hitherto refractory leukemic infiltration of bone marrow. severe side effects in terms of mental confusion and progressive hyperbilirubinemia, however, point to an enhancement not only of antineoplastic effects but also of toxicity in normal tissues. this report demonstrates for the first time that the pharmacodynamic properties of cyclosporin a may not be confined strictly to suppression of normal t-cell functions.;0;0;1;1
early adjuvant adriamycin in superficial bladder carcinoma.;a multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. adriamycin (50 mg/50 ml) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of ta-t1 (o-a) bladder tumors. instillation was repeated twice during the first week, then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year. the tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients, and 29 patients presented with local side-effects. in 24 of these patients chemical cystitis was severe enough for them to drop out of the study. no systemic side-effects were observed. recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow-up and in 72 patients followed for 2-3 years (mean 32 months). of the 82 patients studied after 1 year, 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease. of the 82 evaluable patients, 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year (61%), while 32 presented with one or more recurrences (39%). of these recurrences, 27 were t1 tumors while five progressed to more highly invasive lesions. in patients that were free of recurrence during the first year, 80% remained tumor-free during the 2- to 3-year follow-up period. of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year, only 50% presented with further recurrence once the instillations were stopped. the beneficial effect of adriamycin appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself, the early and repeated instillations after tur, or both.;0;0;0;1
common mutations in brca1 and brca2 do not contribute to early prostate cancer in jewish men.;"background  families with a high incidence of hereditary breast cancer , and subsequently shown to have terminating mutations in brca1 or brca2 , appear to have a higher incidence of prostate cancer among male relatives . we aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of brca1 or brca2 in ashkenazi jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer . methods  we examined genomic dna from 83 ( for brca1 185delag ) or 82 ( for brca2 6174delt ) ashkenazi jewish prostate cancer patients , most of whom were treated at a relatively young age , for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the ashkenazi population . results  our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of brca1 or brca2 . however , only one ( 1 . 15 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0-3 . 6 % ) of the patients was heterozygous for the brca1 mutant allele , and only two were heterozygous for the brca2 mutation ( 2 . 4 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0-6 . 2 % ) . conclusions  the incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence ( about 1 % ) in the general ashkenazi jewish population . this suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers , mutations in brca1 or brca2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer";0;0;0;1
reversal of ammonia coma in rats by l-dopa: a peripheral effect.;ammonia coma was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol nh4cl. this coma was prevented with 1.68 mmol l-dopa given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the ammonium salt injection. the effect of l-dopa was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain ammonia, an increase in brain dopamine, and an increase in renal excretion of ammonia and urea. intraventricular infusion of dopamine sufficient to raise the brain dopamine to the same extent did not prevent the ammonia coma nor affect the blood and brain ammonia concentrations. bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of l-dopa on blood and brain ammonia and the ammonia coma was not prevented. thus, the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma after l-dopa, can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of dopamine on renal function rather than its central action. these results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some encephalopathic patients receiving l-dopa.;0;1;1;0
absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after cocaine-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage.;introduction: cocaine use has been associated with neurovascular complications, including arterial vasoconstriction and vasculitis. however, there are few studies of angiographic effects of cocaine on human cerebral arteries. information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use. methods: we screened patients with sah retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites. quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with sah who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter. qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made. results: thirteen patients with positive cocaine toxicology were compared to 26 controls. there were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid, sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral, precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral, or basilar arteries (p greater than 0.05 for all comparisons, unpaired t-tests). there also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery (p greater than 0.05, unpaired t-tests). qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group. conclusion: no quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or vasculitis could be found in patients who underwent angiography after aneurysmal sah associated with cocaine use.;1;0;1;0
hepatonecrosis and cholangitis related to long-term phenobarbital therapy: an autopsy report of two patients.;phenobarbital (pb) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that pb-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with pb who died suddenly: one as consequence of cardiac arrest, the other of acute bronchopneumonia. at autopsy, analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate, which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells, associated with several foci of necrosis surrounded by a hard ring of non-specific granulomatous tissue. inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen. our findings illustrate that pb may be associated with chronic liver damage, which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences. for this reason, each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of pb-related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction.;0;1;1;0

myo-inositol-1-phosphate (mip) synthase inhibition: in-vivo study in rats.;lithium and valproate are the prototypic mood stabilizers and have diverse structures and targets. both drugs influence inositol metabolism. lithium inhibits impase and valproate inhibits mip synthase. this study shows that mip synthase inhibition does not replicate or augment the effects of lithium in the inositol sensitive pilocarpine-induced seizures model. this lack of effects may stem from the low contribution of de-novo synthesis to cellular inositol supply or to the inhibition of the de-novo synthesis by lithium itself.;0;0;1;0

memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the acetylcholine releaser pg-9.;the effects of pg-9 (3alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate), the acetylcholine releaser, on memory processes and nerve growth factor (ngf) synthesis were evaluated. in the mouse passive-avoidance test, pg-9 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the m1-selective antagonist s-(-)-et-126. in the same experimental conditions, pg-9 (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine-induced amnesia, demonstrating a central localization of the activity. at the highest effective doses, pg-9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole-board test. pg-9 was also able to increase the amount of ngf secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. the maximal ngf contents obtained by pg-9 were 17.6-fold of the control value. during culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of pg-9. the current work indicates the ability of pg-9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of ngf synthesis in astroglial cells. therefore, pg-9 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes.;0;0;1;0
gonosomal mosaicism in myotonic dystrophy patients: involvement of mitotic events in (ctg)n repeat variation and selection against extreme expansion in sperm.;myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) is caused by abnormal expansion of a polymorphic ( ctg ) n repeat , located in the dm protein kinase gene . we determined the ( ctg ) n repeat lengths in a broad range of tissue dnas from patients with mild , classical , or congenital manifestation of dm . differences in the repeat length were seen in somatic tissues from single dm individuals and twins . repeats appeared to expand to a similar extent in tissues originating from the same embryonal origin . in most male patients carrying intermediate- or small-sized expansions in blood , the repeat lengths covered a markedly wider range in sperm . in contrast , male patients with large allele expansions in blood ( > 700 ctgs ) had similar or smaller repeats in sperm , when detectable . sperm alleles with > 1 , 000 ctgs were not seen . we conclude that dm patients can be considered gonosomal mosaics , i . e e . , combined somatic and germ-line tissue mosaics . most remarkably , we observed multiple cases where the length distributions of intermediate- or small-sized alleles in fathers sperm were significantly different from that in their offsprings blood . our combined findings indicate that intergenerational length changes in the unstable ctg repeat are most likely to occur during early embryonic mitotic divisions in both somatic and germ-line tissue formation . both the initial ctg length , the overall number of cell divisions involved in tissue formation , and perhaps a specific selection process in spermatogenesis may influence the dynamics of this process . a model explaining mitotic instability and sex-dependent segregation phenomena in dm manifestation is discussed;0;0;1;0

pseudo-allergic reactions to corticosteroids: diagnosis and alternatives.;"two patients treated with parenteral paramethasone (triniol) and dexamethasone (sedionbel) are described. a few minutes after administration of the drugs, they presented urticaria (patients 1 and 2) and conjunctivitis (patient 1). the purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid. clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and elisa tests were performed. in the two patients, skin and elisa tests with paramethasone were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients. a single-blind parenteral challenge with triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients. we also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them. these results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients. corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. the basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudo-allergy caused by paramethasone.";0;0;1;0

involvement of the mu-opiate receptor in peripheral analgesia.;the intradermal injection of mu (morphine, tyr-d-ala-gly-nme-phe-gly-ol and morphiceptin), kappa (trans-3,4-dichloro-n-methyl-n[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]benzeneactemide) and delta ([d-pen2.5]-enkephalin and [d-ser2]-[leu]enkephalin-thr) selective opioid-agonists, by themselves, did not significantly affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the hindpaw of the rat. intradermal injection of mu, but not delta or kappa opioid-agonists, however, produced dose-dependent inhibition of prostaglandin e2-induced hyperalgesia. the analgesic effect of the mu-agonist morphine was dose-dependently antagonized by naloxone and prevented by co-injection of pertussis toxin. morphine did not, however, alter the hyperalgesia induced by 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate. we conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu-opioid receptor and that this action is mediated by inhibition of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate second messenger system.;0;0;1;0

support for adrenaline-hypertension hypothesis: 18 hour pressor effect after 6 hours adrenaline infusion.;"in a double blind, crossover study 6 h infusions of adrenaline (15 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.458 pmol), noradrenaline (30 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.911 pmol), and a 5% dextrose solution (5.4 ml/h), were given to ten healthy volunteers in random order 2 weeks apart. by means of intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring the haemodynamic effects were followed for 18 h after the infusions were stopped. adrenaline, but not noradrenaline, caused a delayed and protracted pressor effect. over the total postinfusion period systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 6 (sem 2)% and 7 (2)%, respectively, higher than after dextrose infusion (anova, p less than 0.001). thus, ""stress"" levels of adrenaline (230 pg/ml) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effect. these findings are strong support for the adrenaline-hypertension hypothesis in man.";1;1;0;0
a developmental analysis of clonidine's effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats.;under controlled conditions, infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine. previous investigations have determined that, in response to clonidine, ultrasound production increases through the 2nd-week postpartum and decreases thereafter. given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia, we hypothesized that clonidine's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other. therefore, in the present experiment, the effects of clonidine administration (0.5 mg/kg) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2-, 8-, 15-, and 20-day-old rats. age-related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine-induced bradycardia. this experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by-product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine's detrimental effects on cardiovascular function.;1;0;0;0
test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in rodents.;these studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug-induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents. apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain. from such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed. in rats, detection of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions. moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug-induced hypothermia. in mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage. drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both. by contrast, apomorphine-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box. dopamine turnover ratios (dopac:da and hva:da) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts. however, apomorphine-induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments. the implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents.;0;0;1;0

prolonged hypothermia as a bridge to recovery for cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension associated with fulminant hepatic failure.;background: to review evidence-based treatment options in patients with cerebral edema complicating fulminant hepatic failure (fhf) and discuss the potential applications of hypothermia. method: case-based observations from a medical intensive care unit (micu) in a tertiary care facility in a 27-year-old female with fhf from acetaminophen and resultant cerebral edema. results: our patient was admitted to the micu after being found unresponsive with presumed toxicity from acetaminophen which was ingested over a 2-day period. the patient had depressed of mental status lasting at least 24 h prior to admission. initial evaluation confirmed fhf from acetaminophen and cerebral edema. the patient was treated with hyperosmolar therapy, hyperventilation, sedation, and chemical paralysis. her intracranial pressure remained elevated despite maximal medical therapy. we then initiated therapeutic hypothermia which was continued for 5 days. at re-warming, patient had resolution of her cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension. at discharge, she had complete recovery of neurological and hepatic functions. conclusion: in patients with fhf and cerebral edema from acetaminophen overdose, prolonged therapeutic hypothermia could potentially be used as a life saving therapy and a bridge to hepatic and neurological recovery. a clinical trial of hypothermia in patients with this condition is warranted.;1;1;1;0

sodium status influences chronic amphotericin b nephrotoxicity in rats.;the nephrotoxic potential of amphotericin b (5 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks) has been investigated in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats. in salt-depleted rats, amphotericin b decreased creatinine clearance linearly with time, with an 85% reduction by week 3. in contrast, in normal-salt rats creatinine clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3, and in salt-loaded rats creatinine clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43% at week 3. all rats in the sodium-depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal-salt or salt-loaded rat. concentrations of amphotericin b in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study. however, at the end of 3 weeks, amphotericin b levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt-depleted and normal-salt rats than those in salt-loaded rats, with plasma/kidney ratios of 21, 14, and 8 in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats, respectively. in conclusion, reductions in creatinine clearance and renal amphotericin b accumulation after chronic amphotericin b administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by sodium loading in rats.;0;1;0;0
nitro-l-arginine methyl ester: a potential protector against gentamicin ototoxicity.;the nitric oxide (no) inhibitor nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name) may act as an otoprotectant against high-frequency hearing loss caused by gentamicin, but further studies are needed to confirm this.aminoglycoside antibiotics are still widely used by virtue of their efficacy and low cost. their ototoxicity is a serious health problem and, as their ototoxic mechanism involves the production of no, we need to assess the use of no inhibitors for the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced sensorineural hearing loss. in this experimental study we used 30 sprague-dawley rats, 27 of which had gentamicin instilled into the middle ear. the otoprotectant l-name was administered topically to 12/27 animals. its effect was determined in terms of attenuation of hearing loss, measured by shifts in the auditory brainstem response threshold. l-name reduced gentamicin-induced hearing loss in the high-frequency range, but gave no protection in the middle or low frequencies.;0;0;1;0

microinjection of ritanserin into the ca1 region of hippocampus improves scopolamine-induced amnesia in adult male rats.;"the effect of ritanserin (5-ht2 antagonist) on scopolamine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist)-induced amnesia in morris water maze (mwm) was investigated. rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into ca1 region of the hippocampus. one week later, they received repeatedly vehicles (saline, dmso, saline+dmso), scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl saline/side; 30 min before training), ritanserin (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl dmso/side; 20 min before training) and scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl; 30 min before ritanserin injection)+ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl dmso) through cannulae each day. animals were tested for four consecutive days (4 trial/day) in mwm during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged. in the fifth day, the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor, motivational and visual systems. the results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in scopolamine-treated group as compared to saline group. ritanserin-treated rats (4 microg/0.5 microl/side) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to dmso-treated group. however, scopolamine and ritanserin co-administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the scopolamine-treated rats. our findings show that microinjection of ritanserin into the ca1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine-induced amnesia.";0;0;1;0

propranolol antagonism of phenylpropanolamine-induced hypertension.;phenylpropanolamine (ppa) overdose can cause severe hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, and death. we studied the efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of ppa-induced hypertension. subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before ppa or as a rapid intravenous infusion after ppa. ppa, 75 mg alone, increased blood pressure (31 +/- 14 mm hg systolic, 20 +/- 5 mm hg diastolic), and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase (12 +/- 10 mm hg systolic, 10 +/- 7 mm hg diastolic). intravenous propranolol after ppa also decreased blood pressure. left ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography) showed that ppa increased the stroke volume 30% (from 62.5 +/- 20.9 to 80.8 +/- 22.4 ml), the ejection fraction 9% (from 64% +/- 10% to 70% +/- 7%), and cardiac output 14% (from 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.1 +/- 1.0 l/min). intravenous propranolol reversed these effects. systemic vascular resistance was increased by ppa 28% (from 1710 +/- 200 to 2190 +/- 700 dyne x sec/cm5) and was further increased by propranolol 22% (to 2660 +/- 1200 dyne x sec/cm5). we conclude that ppa increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of ppa on cardiac output. that propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of ppa is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine. this is probably because ppa has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine.;1;0;0;0

reversibility of captopril-induced renal insufficiency after prolonged use in an unusual case of renovascular hypertension.;we report a case of severe hypertension with an occluded renal artery to a solitary kidney, who developed sudden deterioration of renal function following treatment with captopril. his renal function remained impaired but stable during 2 years' treatment with captopril but returned to pre-treatment levels soon after cessation of the drug. this indicates reversibility in captopril-induced renal failure even after its prolonged use and suggests that no organic damage occurs to glomerular arterioles following chronic ace inhibition.;1;1;0;0
low incidence of brca2 mutations in breast carcinoma and other cancers.;inherited mutant alleles of familial tumour suppressor genes predispose individuals to particular types of cancer . in addition to an involvement in inherited susceptibility to cancer , these tumour suppressor genes are targets for somatic mutations in sporadic cancers of the same type found in the familial forms . an exception is brca1 , which contributes to a significant fraction of familial breast and ovarian cancer , but undergoes mutation at very low rates in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers . this finding suggests that other genes may be the principal targets for somatic mutation in breast carcinoma . a second , recently identified familial breast cancer gene , brca2 ( refs 5-8 ) , accounts for a proportion of breast cancer roughly equal to brca1 . like brca1 , brca2 behaves as a dominantly inherited tumour suppressor gene . individuals who inherit one mutant allele are at increased risk for breast cancer , and the tumours they develop lose the wild-type allele by heterozygous deletion . the brca2 coding sequence is huge , composed of 26 exons that span 10 , 443 bp . here we investigate the rate of brca2 mutation in sporadic breast cancers and in a set of cell lines that represent twelve other tumour types . surprisingly , mutations in brca2 are infrequent in cancers including breast carcinoma . however , a probable germline mutation in a pancreatic tumour cell line suggests a role for brca2 in susceptibility to pancreatic cancer . .;0;0;1;1
late recovery of renal function in a woman with the hemolytic uremic syndrome.;"a case is reported of the hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) in a woman taking oral contraceptives. she was treated with heparin, dipyridamole and hemodialysis; and after more than three months, her urinary output rose above 500 ml; and six months after the onset of anuria, dialysis treatment was stopped. this case emphasizes the possibility that hus in adults is not invariably irreversible and that, despite prolonged oliguria, recovery of renal function can be obtained. therefore, in adult patients affected by hus, dialysis should not be discontinued prematurely; moreover, bilateral nephrectomy, for treatment of severe hypertension and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, should be performed with caution.";1;1;0;0

mk-801 augments pilocarpine-induced electrographic seizure but protects against brain damage in rats.;1. the authors examined the anticonvulsant effects of mk-801 on the pilocarpine-induced seizure model. intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg) induced tonic and clonic seizure. scopolamine (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (5 mg/kg) prevented development of pilocarpine-induced behavioral seizure but mk-801 (0.5 mg/kg) did not. 2. an electrical seizure measured with hippocampal eeg appeared in the pilocarpine-treated group. scopolamine and pentobarbital blocked the pilocarpine-induced electrographic seizure, mk-801 treatment augmented the electrographic seizure induced by pilocarpine. 3. brain damage was assessed by examining the hippocampus microscopically. pilocarpine produced neuronal death in the hippocampus, which showed pyknotic changes. pentobarbital, scopolamine and mk-801 protected the brain damage by pilocarpine, though in the mk-801-treated group, the pyramidal cells of hippocampus appeared darker than normal. in all treatments, granule cells of the dentate gyrus were not affected. 4. these results indicate that status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine is initiated by cholinergic overstimulation and propagated by glutamatergic transmission, the elevation of which may cause brain damage through an excitatory nmda receptor-mediated mechanism.;0;0;1;0
cardiac na(+) channel dysfunction in brugada syndrome is aggravated by beta(1)-subunit.;"background  mutations in the gene encoding the human cardiac na ( + ) channel alpha-subunit ( hh1 ) are responsible for chromosome 3-linked congenital long-qt syndrome ( lqt3 ) and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation ( ivf ) . an auxiliary beta ( 1 ) -subunit , widely expressed in excitable tissues , shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation toward more negative potentials and restores normal gating kinetics of brain and skeletal muscle na ( + ) channels expressed in xenopus oocytes but has little if any functional effect on the cardiac isoform . here , we characterize the altered effects of a human beta ( 1 ) -subunit ( hbeta ( 1 ) ) on the heterologously expressed hh1 mutation ( t1620m ) previously associated with ivf . methods and results  when expressed alone in xenopus oocytes , t1620m exhibited no persistent currents , in contrast to the lqt3 mutant channels , but the midpoint of steady-state inactivation ( v ( 1 / 2 ) ) was significantly shifted toward more positive potentials than for wild-type hh1 . coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) did not significantly alter current decay or recovery from inactivation of wild-type hh1 ; however , it further shifted the v ( 1 / 2 ) and accelerated the recovery from inactivation of t1620m . oocyte macropatch analysis revealed that the activation kinetics of t1620m were normal . conclusions  it is suggested that coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) exposes a more severe functional defect that results in a greater overlap in the relationship between channel inactivation and activation ( window current ) in t1620m , which is proposed to be a potential pathophysiological mechanism of ivf in vivo . one possible explanation for our finding is an altered alpha- / beta ( 1 ) -subunit association in the mutant . .";0;0;1;0

acute blood pressure elevations with caffeine in men with borderline systemic hypertension.;"whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated. thus, caffeine (3.3 mg/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions. borderline hypertensive men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (bp) of 140 to 160 mm hg and/or diastolic bp 90 to 99 mm hg. low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening bp < 130/85 mm hg. participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12-hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits. caffeine-induced changes in diastolic bp were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004). these findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols. the percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic bp changes exceeded the median control response was 96%. consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive bp levels after caffeine ingestion. thus, in borderline hypertensive men, exaggerated responses to caffeine were: selective for diastolic bp, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives. we suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.";1;0;0;0

possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome related to concomitant treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam.;a 74-year-old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to insomnia, loss of appetite, exhaustion, and agitation. medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1.2 mg alprazolam. on the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment, the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation, disorientation, and severe muscle rigidity with tremors. the patient had a fever (38.2 degrees c), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms. laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase (2218 iu/l), aspartate aminotransferase (134 iu/l), alanine aminotransferase (78 iu/l), and bun (27.9 mg/ml) levels. the patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms. 7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient's serum cpk levels were normalized (175 iu/l). this patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (nms), thus demonstrating that nms-like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment. the adverse drug reaction score obtained by the naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's nms-like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case. the involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected. several risk factors for nms should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion. careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from depression.;1;0;1;0
absence of effect of sertraline on time-based sensitization of cognitive impairment with haloperidol.;"this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus sertraline on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjects. method: all subjects received placebo on day 1 and haloperidol 2 mg on days 2 and 25. from days 9 to 25, subjects were randomly assigned to either sertraline (12 subjects) or placebo (12 subjects); the sertraline dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg/day from days 9 to 16, and remained at 200 mg/day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period. cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24-hour period after dosing on days 1, 2, and 25. results: impairment of cognitive function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing. when single-dose haloperidol was given again 25 days later, greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups, suggesting enhancement of this effect. there was no indication that sertraline exacerbated the impairment produced by haloperidol since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group. three subjects (2 on sertraline and 1 on placebo) withdrew from the study because of side effects. ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment. the side effect profiles of sertraline and of placebo were similar. conclusion: haloperidol produced a clear profile of cognitive impairment that was not worsened by concomitant sertraline administration.";0;0;1;0

tumor suppression and apoptosis of human prostate carcinoma mediated by a genetic locus within human chromosome 10pter-q11.;prostate cancer is the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the united states . yet , despite a large international effort , little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this devastating disease . prostate secretory epithelial cells and androgen-dependent prostate carcinomas undergo apoptosis in response to androgen deprivation and , furthermore , most prostate carcinomas become androgen independent and refractory to further therapeutic manipulations during disease progression . definition of the genetic events that trigger apoptosis in the prostate could provide important insights into critical pathways in normal development as well as elucidate the perturbations of those key pathways in neoplastic transformation . we report the functional definition of a novel genetic locus within human chromosome 10pter-q11 that mediates both in vivo tumor suppression and in vitro apoptosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma cells . a defined fragment of human chromosome 10 was transferred via microcell fusion into a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line . microcell hybrids containing only the region 10pter-q11 were suppressed for tumorigenicity following injection of microcell hybrids into nude mice . furthermore , the complemented hybrids undergo programmed cell death in vitro via a mechanism that does not require nuclear localization of p53 . these data functionally define a novel genetic locus , designated pac1 , for prostate adenocarcinoma 1 , involved in tumor suppression of human prostate carcinoma and furthermore strongly suggest that the cell death pathway can be functionally restored in prostatic adenocarcinoma . .;0;0;1;1

naloxazone pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory, temperature, and behavioral effects of morphine.;behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of morphine were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or naloxazone, an antagonist of high-affinity mu 1 opioid receptors. pretreatment with naloxazone significantly blocked morphine analgesia, catalepsy and hypothermia at a dose which completely eliminated high-affinity binding in brain membranes. moreover, naloxazone significantly attenuated the morphine-induced hypotension and respiratory depression, whereas morphine-induced bradycardia was less affected. results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to morphine.;1;0;1;0
safety and efficacy of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (0.59 mg) in birdshot retinochoroidopathy.;purpose: to report the treatment outcomes of the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (0.59 mg) in patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy whose disease is refractory or intolerant to conventional immunomodulatory therapy. methods: a retrospective case series involving 11 birdshot retinochoroidopathy patients (11 eyes). eleven patients (11 eyes) underwent surgery for fluocinolone acetonide implant (0.59 mg). treatment outcomes of interest were noted at baseline, before fluocinolone acetonide implant, and then at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and beyond 3 years. disease activity markers, including signs of ocular inflammation, evidence of retinal vasculitis, swedish interactive threshold algorithm-short wavelength automated perimetry humphrey visual field analysis, electroretinographic parameters, and optical coherence tomography were recorded. data on occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure were collected in all eyes. results: intraocular inflammation was present in 54.5, 9.9, 11.1, and 0% of patients at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and beyond 3 years after receiving the implant, respectively. active vasculitis was noted in 36.3% patients at baseline and 0% at 3 years of follow-up. more than 20% (47.61-67.2%) reduction in central retinal thickness was noted in all patients with cystoid macular edema at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postimplant. at baseline, 54.5% patients were on immunomodulatory agents. this percentage decreased to 45.45, 44.4, and 14.28% at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postimplant, respectively. adverse events included increased intraocular pressure (54.5%) and cataract formation (100%). conclusion: the data suggest that fluocinolone acetonide implant (0.59 mg) helps to control inflammation in otherwise treatment-refractory cases of birdshot retinochoroidopathy. it is associated with significant side effects of cataract and ocular hypertension requiring treatment.;1;0;0;0

a method for the measurement of tremor, and a comparison of the effects of tocolytic beta-mimetics.;a method permitting measurement of finger tremor as a displacement-time curve is described, using a test system with simple amplitude calibration. the coordinates of the inversion points of the displacement-time curves were transferred through graphical input equipment to punched tape. by means of a computer program, periods and amplitudes of tremor oscillations were calculated and classified. the event frequency for each class of periods and amplitudes was determined. the actions of fenoterol-hydrobromide, ritodrin-hcl and placebo given to 10 healthy subjects by intravenous infusion in a double-blind crossover study were tested by this method. at therapeutic doses both substances raised the mean tremor amplitude to about three times the control level. at the same time, the mean period within each class of amplitudes shortened by 10--20 ms, whereas the mean periods calculated from all oscillations together did not change significantly. after the end of fenoterol-hydrobromide infusion, tremor amplitudes decreased significantly faster than those following ritodrin-hcl infusion.;0;0;1;0
a high incidence of brca1 mutations in 20 breast-ovarian cancer families.;we have analyzed 20 breast-ovarian cancer families , the majority of which show positive evidence of linkage to chromosome 17q12 for germ-line mutations in the brca1 gene . brca1 mutations cosegregating with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility were identified in 16 families , including 1 family with a case of male breast cancer . nine of these mutations have not been reported previously . the majority of mutations were found to generate a premature stop codon leading to the formation of a truncated brca1 protein of 2 % -88 % of the expected normal length . two mutations altered the ring finger domain . sequencing of genomic dna led to the identification of a mutation in the coding region of brca1 in 12 families , and cdna analysis revealed an abnormal or missing brca1 transcript in 4 of the 8 remaining families . a total of eight mutations were associated with a reduced quantity of brca1 transcript . we were unable to detect brca1 mutations in 4 of the 20 families , but only 1 of these was clearly linked to brca1 . it is expected that the majority of clear examples of the breast-ovarian syndrome will be associated with germ-line mutations in the coding region of brca1 . .;0;0;0;1

hla b27 and the genetics of ankylosing spondylitis.;one hundred and twenty-eight of 145 patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( as ) were found to be hla b27 positive . five patients had evidence of a sero-negative peripheral arthritis resembling peripheral psoriatic arthritis and 3 of these were b27 negative . one further b27 negative patients had a sister with ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis and a mother with ulcerative colitis . there was evidence of a somewhat later age of onset of symptoms in b27 negative patients . these findings are interpreted as suggesting some degree of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in ankylosing spondylitis with genes for psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease being important in some individuals , particularly those who are b27 negative . twenty-five first-degree relatives with ankylosing spondylitis were all b27 positive . the only instance of disassociation of b27 and spondylitis in a family was where the proband had ulcerative colitis as well as spondylitis . of 13 b27 positive fathers 3 could be diagnosed as having definite ankylosing spondylitis ( 23 % ) . these findings are thought to provide evidence against the concept that the gene for ankylosing spondylitis is not b27 but a closely linked gene and favour the occurrence of an environmental event affecting approximately one-fifth of b27 positive males to result in disease . .;0;0;1;0

recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with aminocaproic acid therapy and acute renal artery thrombosis. case report.;"epsilon aminocaproic acid (eaca) has been used to prevent rebleeding in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah). although this agent does decrease the frequency of rebleeding, several reports have described thrombotic complications of eaca therapy. these complications have included clinical deterioration and intracranial vascular thrombosis in patients with sah, arteriolar and capillary fibrin thrombi in patients with fibrinolytic syndromes treated with eaca, or other thromboembolic phenomena. since intravascular fibrin thrombi are often observed in patients with fibrinolytic disorders, eaca should not be implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrin thrombi in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation or other ""consumption coagulopathies."" this report describes subtotal infarction of the kidney due to thrombosis of a normal renal artery. this occlusion occurred after eaca therapy in a patient with sah and histopathological documentation of recurrent sah. the corresponding clinical event was characterized by marked hypertension and abrupt neurological deterioration.";1;1;1;0

growth-associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide.;purpose: gap43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting (mfs) in various experimental models of epilepsy. to investigate how gap43 expression (gap43-ir) correlates with mfs, we assessed the intensity (densitometry) and extension (width) of gap43-ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (iml) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine (pilo), previously injected or not with cycloheximide (chx), which has been shown to inhibit mfs. methods: chx was injected before the pilo injection in adult wistar rats. the pilo group was injected with the same drugs, except for chx. animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later, and brain sections were processed for gap43 immunohistochemistry. results: densitometry showed no significant difference regarding gap43-ir in the iml between pilo, chx+pilo, and control groups. however, the results of the width of the gap43-ir band in the iml showed that chx+pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band (p = 0.03) as compared with that in the pilo group. conclusions: our current finding that animals in the chx+pilo group have a gap43-ir band in the iml, similar to that of controls, reinforces prior data on the blockade of mfs in these animals. the change in gap43-ir present in pilo-treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express gap-43.;0;0;1;0

ethambutol and optic neuropathy.;purpose: to demonstrate the association between ethambutol and optic neuropathy. method: thirteen patients who developed optic neuropathy after being treated with ethambutol for tuberculosis of the lung or lymph node at siriraj hospital between 1997 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. the clinical characteristics and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed to determine visual outcome. results: all patients had optic neuropathy between 1 to 6 months (mean = 2.9 months) after starting ethambutol therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg/kg/day (mean = 17 mg/kg/day). seven (54%) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the drug. of 6 patients with irreversible visual impairment, 4 patients had diabetes mellitus, glaucoma and a history of heavy smoking. conclusion: early recognition of optic neuropathy should be considered in patients with ethambutol therapy. a low dose and prompt discontinuation of the drug is recommended particularly in individuals with diabetes mellitus, glaucoma or who are heavy smokers.;0;0;1;0
x inactivation and somatic cell selection rescue female mice carrying a piga-null mutation.;a somatic mutation in the x linked piga gene is responsible for the deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) -anchored proteins on blood cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . no inherited form of gpi-anchor deficiency has been described . because conventional piga gene knockout is associated with high embryonic lethality in chimeric mice , we used the cre / loxp system . we generated mice in which two loxp sites flank part of piga exon 2 . after crossbreeding with female mice of the eiia-cre strain , the floxed allele undergoes cre-mediated recombination with high efficiency during early embryonic development . because of x chromosome inactivation , female offspring are mosaic for cells that express or lack gpi-linked proteins . analysis of mosaic mice showed that in heart , lung , kidney , brain , and liver , mainly wild-type piga is active , suggesting that these tissues require gpi-linked proteins . the salient exceptions were spleen , thymus , and red blood cells , which had almost equal numbers of cells expressing the wild-type or the recombined allele , implying that gpi-linked proteins are not essential for the derivation of these tissues . piga ( - ) cells had no growth advantage , suggesting that other factors are needed for their clonal dominance in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . .;1;1;1;0

delirium in a patient with toxic flecainide plasma concentrations: the role of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine.;"objective: to describe a case of flecainide-induced delirium associated with a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine. case summary: a 69-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with a history of confusion and paranoia over the past several days. on admission the patient was taking carvedilol 12 mg twice daily, warfarin 2 mg/day, folic acid 1 mg/day, levothyroxine 100 microg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day, paroxetine 40 mg/day, and flecainide 100 mg twice daily. flecainide had been started 2 weeks prior for atrial fibrillation. laboratory test findings on admission were notable only for a flecainide plasma concentration of 1360 microg/l (reference range 200-1000). a metabolic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine, which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years, was considered. paroxetine was discontinued and the dose of flecainide was reduced to 50 mg twice daily. her delirium resolved 3 days later. discussion: flecainide and pharmacologically similar agents that interact with sodium channels may cause delirium in susceptible patients. a medline search (1966-january 2009) revealed one in vivo pharmacokinetic study on the interaction between flecainide, a cyp2d6 substrate, and paroxetine, a cyp2d6 inhibitor, as well as 3 case reports of flecainide-induced delirium. according to the naranjo probability scale, flecainide was the probable cause of the patient's delirium; the horn drug interaction probability scale indicates a possible pharmacokinetic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine. conclusions: supratherapeutic flecainide plasma concentrations may cause delirium. because toxicity may occur when flecainide is prescribed with paroxetine and other potent cyp2d6 inhibitors, flecainide plasma concentrations should be monitored closely with commencement of cyp2d6 inhibitors.";1;0;0;0
erectile dysfunction occurs following substantia nigra lesions in the rat.;erectile function was assessed 6 weeks following uni- and bilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra nucleus of the brain. behavioral apomorphine-induced penile erections were reduced (5/8) and increased (3/8) in uni- and bilateral lesioned animals. intracavernous pressures, following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve, decreased in lesioned animals. lesions of the substantia nigra were confirmed by histology. concentration of dopamine and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats. lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with erectile dysfunction in rats and may serve as a model to study erectile dysfunction in parkinson's disease.;0;0;1;0

frequent inactivation of pten/mmac1 in primary prostate cancer.;sporadic prostate carcinoma is the most common male cancer in the western world , yet many of the major genetic events involved in the progression of this often fatal cancer remain to be elucidated . numerous cytogenetic and allelotype studies have reported frequent loss of heterozygosity on chromosomal arm 10q in sporadic prostate cancer . deletion mapping studies have unambiguously identified a region of chromosome 10q23 to be the minimal area of loss . a new tumor suppressor gene , pten / mmac1 , was isolated recently at this region of chromosome 10q23 and found to be inactivated by mutation in three prostate cancer cell lines . we screened 80 prostate tumors by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q23 to be deleted in 23 cases . we then proceeded with sequence analysis of the entire pten / mmac1 coding region and tested for homozygous deletion with new intragenic markers in these 23 cases with 10q23 loss of heterozygosity . the identification of the second mutational event in 10 ( 43 % ) tumors establishes pten / mmac1 as a main inactivation target of 10q loss in sporadic prostate cancer . .;0;0;0;1
mechanisms of hypertension induced by nitric oxide (no) deficiency: focus on venous function.;loss of endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide (no) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction. experimental hypertension created by the removal of no, however, involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activity. these include augmented endothelin-1 (et-1) release, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and elevated tissue oxidative stress. we hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle (venomotor) tone plays a role in nomega-nitro-l-arginine (lnna) hypertension through these mechanisms. rats were treated with the no synthase inhibitor lnna (0.5 g/l in drinking water) for 2 weeks. mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 +/- 2 mm hg in control and 194 +/- 5 mm hg in lnna rats (p<0.05). carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction. maximal contraction to norepinephrine was modestly reduced in arteries from lnna compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to et-1 was significantly reduced (54% control). maximum contraction of vena cava to norepinephrine (37% control) also was reduced but no change in response to et-1 was observed. mean circulatory filling pressure, an in vivo measure of venomotor tone, was not elevated in lnna hypertension at 1 or 2 weeks after lnna. the superoxide scavenger tempol (30, 100, and 300 micromol kg(-1), iv) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose-dependent decrease in lnna rats (-18 +/- 8, -26 +/- 15, and -54 +/- 11 mm hg). similarly, ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater fall in lnna hypertensive rats (76 +/- 9 mm hg) compared with control rats (35 +/- 10 mm hg). carotid arteries, vena cava, and sympathetic ganglia from lnna rats had higher basal levels of superoxide compared with those from control rats. these data suggest that while no deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in both arterial and venous vessels, the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension.;1;0;1;0

randomized comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone for the treatment of first-episode schizophrenia: 4-month outcomes.;"objective: the authors compared 4-month treatment outcomes for olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. method: one hundred twelve subjects (70% male; mean age=23.3 years [sd = 5.1]) with first-episode schizophrenia (75%), schizophreniform disorder (17%), or schizoaffective disorder (8%) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day) or risperidone (1-6 mg/day). results: response rates did not significantly differ between olanzapine (43.7%, 95% ci=28.8%-58.6%) and risperidone (54.3%, 95% ci=39.9%-68.7%). among those responding to treatment, more subjects in the olanzapine group (40.9%, 95% ci=16.8%-65.0%) than in the risperidone group (18.9%, 95% ci=0%-39.2%) had subsequent ratings not meeting response criteria. negative symptom outcomes and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications. extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1.4 (95% ci=1.2-1.6) with risperidone and 1.2 (95% ci=1.0-1.4) with olanzapine. significantly more weight gain occurred with olanzapine than with risperidone: the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17.3% (95% ci=14.2%-20.5%) with olanzapine and 11.3% (95% ci=8.4%-14.3%) with risperidone. body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24.3 (95% ci=22.8-25.7) versus 28.2 (95% ci=26.7-29.7) with olanzapine and 23.9 (95% ci=22.5-25.3) versus 26.7 (95% ci=25.2-28.2) with risperidone. conclusions: clinical outcomes with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine, and response may be more stable. olanzapine may have an advantage for motor side effects. both medications caused substantial rapid weight gain, but weight gain was greater with olanzapine.";0;0;1;0
basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis and psychological distress in recreational ecstasy polydrug users.;rationale: ecstasy (mdma) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with psychobiological dysfunction. while some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in hpa functionality in recreational users. objectives: the current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the hpa axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. method: seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy-polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). on day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. results: both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. on day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. on day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. conclusions: the increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational ecstasy-polydrug users. dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of ecstasy.;0;1;1;0

two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to beta-carboline-induced seizures are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other gaba(a) receptor ligands.;two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity (bs line) or resistance (br line) to seizures induced by a single i.p. injection of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-ccm), an inverse agonist of the gaba(a) receptor benzodiazepine site. our aim was to characterize both lines' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the gaba(a) receptor. we measured diazepam-induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus-maze test, diazepam-induced sedation by recording the vigilance states, and picrotoxin- and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures after i.p. injections. results presented here show that the differential sensitivities of bs and br lines to beta-ccm can be extended to diazepam, picrotoxin, and pentylenetetrazol, suggesting a genetic selection of a general sensitivity and resistance to several ligands of the gaba(a) receptor.;0;0;1;0

participation of a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway in the rat brain in clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia.;the effects of microinjection of clonidine (1-10 micrograms in 1 microliter) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata on cardiovascular function were assessed in urethane-anesthetized rats. intramedullary administration of clonidine, but not saline vehicle, caused a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. the clonidine-induced hypotension was antagonized by prior spinal transection, but not bilateral vagotomy. on the other hand, the clonidine-induced bradycardia was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy, but not spinal transection. furthermore, selective destruction of the spinal 5-ht nerves, produced by bilateral spinal injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor or the bradycardiac responses to clonidine microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata in rats. the data indicate that a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia. the induced hypotension is brought about by a decrease in sympathetic efferent activity, whereas the induced bradycardia was due to an increase in vagal efferent activity.;1;0;1;0

comparative cognitive and subjective side effects of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy middle-aged and older adults.;this study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy, older (> 65 years), and middle-aged (35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain. seventy-one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition (placebo, 10-mg oxycodone). plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose (p < .01) and pupil size, an indication of physiological effects of the medication, peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose (p < .01). significant declines in simple and sustained attention, working memory, and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose. for almost all cognitive measures, there were no medication by age-interaction effects, which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge. this study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic pain, neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle-aged adults. perspective: study findings indicate that the metabolism, neurocognitive effects, and physical side effects of oral oxycodone are similar for healthy middle-aged and older adults. therefore, clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults.;0;0;1;0
the ataxia-telangiectasia gene product, a constitutively expressed nuclear protein that is not up-regulated following genome damage.;the product of the ataxia-telangiectasia gene ( atm ) was identified by using an antiserum developed to a peptide corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence . the atm protein is a single , high-molecular weight protein predominantly confined to the nucleus of human fibroblasts , but is present in both nuclear and microsomal fractions from human lymphoblast cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes . atm protein levels and localization remain constant throughout all stages of the cell cycle . truncated atm protein was not detected in lymphoblasts from ataxia-telangiectasia patients homozygous for mutations leading to premature protein termination . exposure of normal human cells to gamma-irradiation and the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin had no effect on atm protein levels , in contrast to a noted rise in p53 levels over the same time interval . these findings are consistent with a role for the atm protein in ensuring the fidelity of dna repair and cell cycle regulation following genome damage . .;0;0;1;0

acute bronchodilating effects of ipratropium bromide and theophylline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;the bronchodilator effects of a single dose of ipratropium bromide aerosol (36 micrograms) and short-acting theophylline tablets (dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10-20 micrograms/ml) were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15% increase in the fev1 (responders) were 31% and 90%, respectively, for ipratropium and 17% and 50%, respectively, for theophylline. the average fev1 increases during the 6-hour observation period were 18% for ipratropium and 8% for theophylline. the mean duration of action was 3.8 hours with ipratropium and 2.4 hours with theophylline. while side effects were rare, those experienced after theophylline use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. these results show that ipratropium is a more potent bronchodilator than oral theophylline in patients with chronic airflow obstruction.;1;0;1;0
ketamine sedation for the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department.;"background: there recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of ketamine, a unique anesthetic, for emergency-department procedures requiring sedation. the purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children's fractures in the emergency department. methods: one hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level-i trauma center were prospectively evaluated. ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen. a board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse. any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the children's hospital of eastern ontario pain scale (cheops). results: the average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes). the average score according to the children's hospital of eastern ontario pain scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction. adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children. ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation. patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients. blood pressure and heart rate remained stable. minor side effects included nausea (thirteen patients), emesis (eight of the thirteen patients with nausea), clumsiness (evident as ataxic movements in ten patients), and dysphoric reaction (one patient). no long-term sequelae were noted, and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares. conclusions: ketamine reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department at our institution. ketamine should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department, where proper one-on-one monitoring is used and board-certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient.";1;0;1;0

when drugs disappear from the patient: elimination of intravenous medication by hemodiafiltration.;twenty-three hours after heart transplantation, life-threatening acute right heart failure was diagnosed in a patient requiring continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (cvvhdf). increasing doses of catecholamines, sedatives, and muscle relaxants administered through a central venous catheter were ineffective. however, a bolus of epinephrine injected through an alternative catheter provoked a hypertensive crisis. thus, interference with the central venous infusion by the dialysis catheter was suspected. the catheters were changed, and hemodynamics stabilized at lower catecholamine doses. when the effects of iv drugs are inadequate in patients receiving cvvhdf, interference with adjacent catheters resulting in elimination of the drug by cvvhdf should be suspected.;1;0;0;0

brca1 required for transcription-coupled repair of oxidative dna damage.;the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca1 encodes a zinc finger protein of unknown function . association of the brca1 protein with the dna repair protein rad51 and changes in the phosphorylation and cellular localization of the protein after exposure to dna-damaging agents are consistent with a role for brca1 in dna repair . here , it is shown that mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in brca1 are defective in the ability to carry out transcription-coupled repair of oxidative dna damage , and are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide . these results suggest that brca1 participates , directly or indirectly , in transcription-coupled repair of oxidative dna damage . .;0;0;0;1
putative x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy gene shares unexpected homology with abc transporters.;adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) is an x-linked disease affecting 1 / 20 , 000 males either as cerebral ald in childhood or as adrenomyeloneuropathy ( amn ) in adults . childhood ald is the more severe form , with onset of neurological symptoms between 5-12 years of age . central nervous system demyelination progresses rapidly and death occurs within a few years . amn is a milder form of the disease with onset at 15-30 years of age and a more progressive course . adrenal insufficiency ( addisons disease ) may remain the only clinical manifestation of ald . the principal biochemical abnormality of ald is the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids ( vlcfa ) because of impaired beta-oxidation in peroxisomes . the normal oxidation of vlcfa-coa in patients fibroblasts suggested that the gene coding for the vlcfa-coa synthetase could be a candidate gene for ald . here we use positional cloning to identify a gene partially deleted in 6 of 85 independent patients with ald . in familial cases , the deletions segregated with the disease . an identical deletion was detected in two brothers presenting with different clinical ald phenotypes . candidate exons were identified by computer analysis of genomic sequences and used to isolate complementary dnas by exon connection and screening of cdna libraries . the deduced protein sequence shows significant sequence identity to a peroxisomal membrane protein of m ( r ) 70k that is involved in peroxisome biogenesis and belongs to the atp-binding cassette superfamily of transporters . .;0;1;1;0

a case of postoperative anxiety due to low dose droperidol used with patient-controlled analgesia.;a multiparous woman in good psychological health underwent urgent caesarean section in labour. postoperatively, she was given a patient-controlled analgesia device delivering boluses of diamorphine 0.5 mg and droperidol 0.025 mg. whilst using the device she gradually became anxious, the feeling worsening after each bolus. the diagnosis of droperidol-induced psychological disturbance was not made straight away although on subsequent close questioning the patient gave a very clear history. after she had received a total of only 0.9 mg droperidol, a syringe containing diamorphine only was substituted and her unease resolved completely. we feel that, although the dramatic extrapyramidal side effects of dopaminergic antiemetics are well known, more subtle manifestations may easily be overlooked.;0;1;0;0
ashkenazi jewish population frequencies for common mutations in brca1 and brca2.;brca1 and brca2 are the two major identified causes of inherited breast cancer , with mutations in either gene conferring up to 80-90 % lifetime risk of breast cancer in carrier females . mutations in brca1 account for approximately 45 % of familial breast cancer and 90 % of inherited breast / ovarian cancer , whereas mutations in brca2 account for a comparable percentage of inherited breast cancer cases . over 85 distinct brca1 mutations and a growing list of brca2 mutations have been identified , with the majority resulting in protein truncation . a specific brca1 mutation , 185delag , has a reported increased carrier frequency of approximately 0 . 9 % in the ashkenazi jewish population , but is also found in rare non-jewish patients with a different haplotype . the 6174delt mutation in brca2 was recently identified as a frequent mutation in 8 out of 107 ashkenazi jewish women diagnosed with breast cancer by age 50 ( ref . 8 ) , as well as in three ashkenazi male breast cancer patients . we have conducted a large-scale population study to investigate the prevalence of specific brca1 and brca2 mutations in ashkenazi jewish individuals who were unselected for breast cancer . brca1 mutation screening on approximately 3 , 000 ashkenazi jewish samples determined a carrier frequency of 1 . 09 % for the 185delag mutation and 0 . 13 % for the 5382insc mutation . brca2 analysis on 3 , 085 individuals from the same population showed a carrier frequency of 1 . 52 % for the 6174delt mutation . this expanded population-based study confirms that the brca1 185delag mutation and the brca2 6174delt mutation constitute the two most frequent mutation alleles predisposing to hereditary breast cancer among the ashkenazim , and suggests a relatively lower penetrance for the 6174delt mutation in brca2;0;0;1;1

thiopentone pretreatment for propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients.;"this study investigated propofol injection pain in patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia. in a randomized, double-blind trial, 90 women were allocated to receive one of three treatments prior to induction of anaesthesia with propofol. patients in group c received 2 ml normal saline, group l, 2 ml, lidocaine 2% (40 mg) and group t, 2 ml thiopentone 2.5% (50 mg). venous discomfort was assessed with a visual analogue scale (vas) 5-15 sec after commencing propofol administration using an infusion pump (rate 1000 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). loss of consciousness occurred in 60-90 sec. visual analogue scores (mean +/- sd) during induction were lower in groups l (3.3 +/- 2.5) and t (4.1 +/- 2.7) than in group c (5.6 +/- 2.3); p = 0.0031. the incidence of venous discomfort was lower in group l (76.6%; p < 0.05) than in group c (100%) but not different from group t (90%). the vas scores for recall of pain in the recovery room were correlated with the vas scores during induction (r = 0.7045; p < 0.0001). recovery room discharge times were similar: c (75.9 +/- 19.4 min); l 73.6 +/- 21.6 min); t (77.1 +/- 18.9 min). assessing their overall satisfaction, 89.7% would choose propofol anaesthesia again. we conclude that lidocaine reduces the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients whereas thiopentone only reduces its severity.";0;0;1;0
splicing defects in the ataxia-telangiectasia gene, atm: underlying mutations and consequences.;mutations resulting in defective splicing constitute a significant proportion ( 30 / 62 [ 48 % ] ) of a new series of mutations in the atm gene in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia ( at ) that were detected by the protein-truncation assay followed by sequence analysis of genomic dna . fewer than half of the splicing mutations involved the canonical ag splice-acceptor site or gt splice-donor site . a higher percentage of mutations occurred at less stringently conserved sites , including silent mutations of the last nucleotide of exons , mutations in nucleotides other than the conserved ag and gt in the consensus splice sites , and creation of splice-acceptor or splice-donor sites in either introns or exons . these splicing mutations led to a variety of consequences , including exon skipping and , to a lesser degree , intron retention , activation of cryptic splice sites , or creation of new splice sites . in addition , 5 of 12 nonsense mutations and 1 missense mutation were associated with deletion in the cdna of the exons in which the mutations occurred . no atm protein was detected by western blotting in any at cell line in which splicing mutations were identified . several cases of exon skipping in both normal controls and patients for whom no underlying defect could be found in genomic dna were also observed , suggesting caution in the interpretation of exon deletions observed in atm cdna when there is no accompanying identification of genomic mutations . .;0;0;1;0
inhibition of sympathoadrenal activity by atrial natriuretic factor in dogs.;in six conscious, trained dogs, maintained on a normal sodium intake of 2 to 4 meq/kg/day, sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of norepinephrine and epinephrine during 15-minute i.v. infusions of human alpha-atrial natriuretic factor. mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- sem) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no tachycardia and no augmentation of the norepinephrine release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable hypotension induced by hydralazine or nitroglycerin. the release rate of epinephrine (control, 6.7 +/- 0.6 ng/kg/min) declined immediately during infusions of atrial natriuretic factor to a minimum of 49 +/- 5% of control (p less than 0.001) during 0.1 microgram/kg/min and to 63 +/- 5% (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05) or 95 +/- 13% (not significant) during 0.3 or 1.0 microgram/kg/min. steady state arterial plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were 39 +/- 10 pg/ml (n = 6) during infusions of saline and 284 +/- 24 pg/ml (n = 6) and 1520 +/- 300 pg/ml (n = 9) during 0.03 and 0.1 microgram/kg/min infusions of the factor.(abstract truncated at 250 words);1;1;0;0

increased high-density lipoprotein levels caused by a common cholesteryl-ester transfer protein gene mutation.;background and methods . the plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein ( cetp ) catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein ( hdl ) to other lipoproteins . we recently described a japanese family with increased hdl levels and cetp deficiency due to a splicing defect of the cetp gene . to assess the frequency and phenotype of this condition , we screened 11 additional families with high hdl levels by means of a radioimmunoassay for cetp and dna analysis . results . we found the same cetp gene mutation in four families from three different regions of japan . analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the mutant cetp allele showed that all probands were homozygous for the identical haplotype . family members homozygous for cetp deficiency ( n = 10 ) had moderate hypercholesterolemia ( mean total cholesterol level [ + / - sd ] , 7 . 01 + / - 0 . 83 mmol per liter ) , markedly increased levels of hdl cholesterol ( 4 . 24 + / - 1 . 01 mmol per liter ) and apolipoprotein a-i , and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( 1 . 99 + / - 0 . 80 mmol per liter ) and apolipoprotein b . members heterozygous for the deficiency ( n = 20 ) , whose cetp levels were in the lower part of the normal range , had moderately increased levels of hdl cholesterol and apolipoprotein a-i and an increased ratio of hdl subclass 2 to hdl subclass 3 , as compared with unaffected family members ( 1 . 5 + / - 0 . 8 vs . 0 . 7 + / - 0 . 4 ) . cetp deficiency was not found in six unrelated subjects with elevated hdl cholesterol levels who were from different parts of the united states . conclusions . cetp deficiency appears to be a frequent cause of increased hdl levels in the population of japan , possibly because of a founder effect . the results that we observed in heterozygotes suggest that cetp normally plays a part in the regulation of levels of hdl subclass 2 . there was no evidence of premature atherosclerosis in the families with cetp deficiency . in fact , the lipoprotein profile of persons with cetp deficiency is potentially antiatherogenic and may be associated with an increased life span .;0;0;1;0

rate of ymdd motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated iranian patients with chronic hepatitis b virus infection.;background: lamivudine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b patients. recent studies show that the ymdd motif mutants (resistant hepatitis b virus) occur as natural genome variability in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis b patients. in this study we aimed to determine the rate of ymdd motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis b patients in iran. patients and methods: a total of 77 chronic hepatitis b patients who had not been treated with lamivudine were included in the study. serum samples from patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) for detection of ymdd motif mutants. all patients were also tested for liver enzymes, anti-hcv, hbeag, and anti-hbe. results: of the 77 patients enrolled in the study, 73% were male and 27% were female. mean alt and ast levels were 124.4+/-73.4 and 103.1+/-81 iu/l, respectively. hbeag was positive in 40% and anti-hbe in 60% of the patients. anti-hcv was negative in all of them. ymdd motif mutants were not detected in any of the patients despite the liver enzyme levels and the presence of hbeag or anti-hbe. conclusion: although the natural occurrence of ymdd motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated patients with chronic hepatitis b has been reported, these mutants were not detected in iranian lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis b patients.;0;1;0;0

cocaine-induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists than amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.;the influence of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on cocaine-and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was examined in mice. all adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice, and the effects were dose-dependent. it seems that adenosine a1 and a2 receptors might be involved in this reaction. moreover, all adenosine receptor agonists: 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (cgs 21680), a2a receptor agonist, n6-cyclopentyladenosine (cpa), a1 receptor agonist, and 5'-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (neca), a2/a1 receptor agonist significantly and dose-dependently decreased cocaine-induced locomotor activity. cpa reduced cocaine action at the doses which, given alone, did not influence motility, while cgs 21680 and neca decreased the action of cocaine at the doses which, given alone, decreased locomotor activity in animals. these results suggest the involvement of both adenosine receptors in the action of cocaine although agonists of a1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it. the selective blockade of a2 adenosine receptor by dmpx (3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine) significantly enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity of animals. caffeine had similar action but the effect was not significant. cpt (8-cyclopentyltheophylline)--a1 receptor antagonist, did not show any influence in this test. similarly, all adenosine receptor agonists decreased amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine-induced hyperactivity. the selective blockade of a2 adenosine receptors (dmpx) and non-selective blockade of adenosine receptors (caffeine) significantly increased the action of amphetamine in the locomotor activity test. our results have shown that all adenosine receptor agonists (a1 and a2) reduce cocaine- and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and indicate that cocaine-induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists (particularly a1 receptors) than amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.;0;0;1;0
wiskott-aldrich syndrome protein, a novel effector for the gtpase cdc42hs, is implicated in actin polymerization.;the rho family of gtpases control diverse biological processes , including cell morphology and mitogenesis . we have identified wasp , the protein that is defective in wiskott-aldrich syndrome ( was ) , as a novel effector for cdc42hs , but not for the other rho family members , rac and rho . this interaction is dependent on the presence of the g protein-binding domain . cellular expression of epitope-tagged wasp produces clusters of wasp that are highly enriched in polymerized actin . this clustering is not observed with a c-terminally deleted wasp and is inhibited by coexpression with dominant negative cdc42hs-n17 , but not with dominant negative forms of rac or rho . thus , wasp provides a novel link between cdc42hs and the actin cytoskeleton , which suggests a molecular mechanism for many of the cellular abnormalities in was . the wasp sequence contains two novel domains that are homologous to other proteins involved in action organization . .;0;0;1;0
mitral annuloplasty as a ventricular restoration method for the failing left ventricle: a pilot study.;"background and aim of the study: undersized mitral annuloplasty (map) is effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and functional mitral regurgitation (mr) since, as well as addressing the mr, the map may also reshape the dilated left ventricular (lv) base. however, the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on lv function in the absence of underlying mr remain incompletely understood. the study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of acute heart failure. methods: six dogs underwent map with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus, using four mattress sutures. the sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy. sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function. acute heart failure was induced by propranolol and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass; an absence of mr was confirmed by echocardiography. map was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets. data were acquired at baseline, after induction of acute heart failure, and after map. results: map decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure-commissure and septal-lateral directions. concomitantly, the diastolic diameter of the lv base and lv sphericity decreased (i.e., improved) from 37.4 +/- 9.3 to 35.9 +/- 10 mm (p = 0.063), and from 67.9 +/- 18.6% to 65.3 +/- 18.9% (p = 0.016), respectively. decreases were evident in both lv end-diastolic pressure (from 17 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 6 mmhg, p = 0.0480 and tau (from 48 +/- 8 to 45 +/- 8 ms, p <0.01), while fractional shortening at the lv base increased from 7.7 +/- 4.5% to 9.4 +/- 4.5% (p = 0.045). after map, increases were identified in both cardiac output (from 1.54 +/- 0.57 to 1.65 +/- 0.57 1/min) and emax (from 1.86 +/- 0.9 to 2.41 +/- 1.31 mmhg/ml). conclusion: the data acquired suggest that isolated map may have certain benefits on lv dimension/function in acute heart failure, even in the absence of mr. however, further investigations are warranted in a model of chronic heart failure.";1;0;1;0
cortical motor overactivation in parkinsonian patients with l-dopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesia.;we have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rcbf) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on l-dopa medication, the first one without l-dopa induced dyskinesia (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose dyskinesia (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects. single photon emission tomography with i.v. 133xe was used to measure the rcbf changes. the dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non-dyskinetic parkinsonian patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi- and contralateral primary motor areas. these results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like l-dopa-induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.;0;0;1;0

an evaluation of amikacin nephrotoxicity in the hematology/oncology population.;"amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empirical double gram-negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infections. strategies of extended-interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population. to evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended-interval amikacin. the occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed. the occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (p = 1.00). six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended-interval group (p = 0.002). the occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups. efficacy could not be assessed.";0;1;0;0
a single neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine induces a long-lasting depressive-like behaviour in mice.;methamphetamine (meth) triggers a disruption of the monoaminergic system and meth abuse leads to negative emotional states including depressive symptoms during drug withdrawal. however, it is currently unknown if the acute toxic dosage of meth also causes a long-lasting depressive phenotype and persistent monoaminergic deficits. thus, we now assessed the depressive-like behaviour in mice at early and long-term periods following a single high meth dose (30 mg/kg, i.p.). meth did not alter the motor function and procedural memory of mice as assessed by swimming speed and escape latency to find the platform in a cued version of the water maze task. however, meth significantly increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test at 3 and 49 days post-administration. this depressive-like profile induced by meth was accompanied by a marked depletion of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, indicated by a reduction in the levels of dopamine, dopac and hva, tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin, observed at both 3 and 49 days post-administration. in parallel, another neurochemical feature of depression--astroglial dysfunction--was unaffected in the cortex and the striatal levels of the astrocytic protein marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, were only transiently increased at 3 days. these findings demonstrate for the first time that a single high dose of meth induces long-lasting depressive-like behaviour in mice associated with a persistent disruption of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis.;0;0;1;0

reducing harm associated with anticoagulation: practical considerations of argatroban therapy in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.;"argatroban is a hepatically metabolized, direct thrombin inhibitor used for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) and for patients with or at risk of hit undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). the objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of argatroban therapy in hit. the us fda-recommended argatroban dose in hit is 2 microg/kg/min (reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients), adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times (aptts) 1.5-3 times baseline (not >100 seconds). contemporary experiences indicate that reduced doses are also needed in patients with conditions associated with hepatic hypoperfusion, e.g. heart failure, yet are unnecessary for renal dysfunction, adult age, sex, race/ethnicity or obesity. argatroban 0.5-1.2 microg/kg/min typically supports therapeutic aptts. the fda-recommended dose during pci is 25 microg/kg/min (350 microg/kg initial bolus), adjusted to achieve activated clotting times (acts) of 300-450 sec. for pci, argatroban has not been investigated in hepatically impaired patients; dose adjustment is unnecessary for adult age, sex, race/ethnicity or obesity, and lesser doses may be adequate with concurrent glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibition. argatroban prolongs the international normalized ratio, and published approaches for monitoring the argatroban-to-warfarin transition should be followed. major bleeding with argatroban is 0-10% in the non-interventional setting and 0-5.8% periprocedurally. argatroban has no specific antidote, and if excessive anticoagulation occurs, argatroban infusion should be stopped or reduced. improved familiarity of healthcare professionals with argatroban therapy in hit, including in special populations and during pci, may facilitate reduction of harm associated with hit (e.g. fewer thromboses) or its treatment (e.g. fewer argatroban medication errors).";1;1;0;0
haploinsufficiency of the transcription factors foxc1 and foxc2 results in aberrant ocular development.;anterior segment developmental disorders , including axenfeld-rieger anomaly ( ara ) , variably associate with harmfully elevated intraocular pressure ( iop ) , which causes glaucoma . clinically observed dysgenesis does not correlate with iop , however , and the etiology of glaucoma development is not understood . the forkhead transcription factor genes foxc1 ( formerly mf1 ) and foxc2 ( formerly mfh1 ) are expressed in the mesenchyme from which the ocular drainage structures derive . mutations in the human homolog of foxc1 , fkhl7 , cause dominant anterior segment defects and glaucoma in various families . we show that foxc1 ( + / - ) mice have anterior segment abnormalities similar to those reported in human patients . these abnormalities include small or absent schlemms canal , aberrantly developed trabecular meshwork , iris hypoplasia , severely eccentric pupils and displaced schwalbes line . the penetrance of clinically obvious abnormalities varies with genetic background . in some affected eyes , collagen bundles were half normal diameter , or collagen and elastic tissue were very sparse . thus , abnormalities in extracellular matrix synthesis or organization may contribute to development of the ocular phenotypes . despite the abnormalities in ocular drainage structures in foxc1 ( + / - ) mice , iop was normal in almost all mice analyzed , on all genetic backgrounds and at all ages . similar abnormalities were found in foxc2 ( + / - ) mice , but no disease-associated mutations were identified in the human homolog fkhl14 in 32 ara patients . foxc1 ( + / - ) and foxc2 ( + / - ) mice are useful models for studying anterior segment development and its anomalies , and may allow identification of genes that interact with foxc1 and foxc2 ( or fkhl7 and fkhl14 ) to produce a phenotype with elevated iop and glaucoma . .;0;0;1;0

dobutamine stress echocardiography: a sensitive indicator of diminished myocardial function in asymptomatic doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer.;doxorubicin is an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic cardiomyopathy. to develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for cardiac damage due to doxorubicin, a cohort study was performed using dobutamine infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long-term survivors of childhood cancer treated with doxorubicin from healthy control subjects. echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients (mean age 16 +/- 5 years) treated from 1.6 to 14.3 years (median 5.3) before this study with 27 to 532 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (mean 196) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age-matched control subjects. graded dobutamine infusions of 0.5, 2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg per min were administered. echocardiographic doppler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rate. dobutamine infusion at 10 micrograms/kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50% incidence rate of adverse symptoms. the most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects, end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in doxorubicin-treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with dobutamine stimulation. end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the doxorubicin-treated group was 11 +/- 1.9 mm versus 13.1 +/- 1.5 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01). end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at the 5-micrograms/kg per min dobutamine infusion for the doxorubicin-treated group was 14.1 +/- 2.4 mm versus 19.3 +/- 2.6 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01).(abstract truncated at 250 words);1;0;1;1
detection of eight brca1 mutations in 10 breast/ovarian cancer families, including 1 family with male breast cancer.;genetic epidemiological evidence suggests that mutations in brca1 may be responsible for approximately one half of early onset familial breast cancer and the majority of familial breast / ovarian cancer . the recent cloning of brca1 allows for the direct detection of mutations , but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for cancer susceptibility is unknown . we analyzed genomic dna from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer , using sscp assays . variant sscp bands were subcloned and sequenced . allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen dna from control individuals . six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families . a frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer . a 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy . mutations were detected throughout the gene , and only one was detected in more than a single family . these results provide further evidence that inherited breast and ovarian cancer can occur as a consequence of a wide array of brca1 mutations . these results suggests that development of a screening test for brca1 mutations will be technically challenging . the finding of a mutation in a family with male breast cancer , not previously thought to be related to brca1 , also illustrates the potential difficulties of genetic counseling for individuals known to carry mutations . .;0;0;0;1

promotional effects of testosterone and dietary fat on prostate carcinogenesis in genetically susceptible rats.;germfree (gf) lobund strain wistar (lw) rats, fed vegetable diet l-485, have developed prostate adenocarcinomas spontaneously (10% incidence) at average age 34 months. conventional lw rats, implanted with testosterone at age 4 months, developed a higher incidence of prostate cancer after an average interval of 14 months: 24% had developed gross tumors, and 40% when it included microscopic tumors. preliminary results indicate that testosterone-treated lw rats that were fed the same diet, which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20% fat, developed prostate cancer after intervals of 6-12 months. aged gf sprague-dawley (sd) rats have not developed prostate cancer spontaneously. conventional sd rats fed diet l-485 and treated with testosterone developed only prostatitis. experimental designs should consider genetic susceptibility as a basic prerequisite for studies on experimental prostate cancer.;0;0;0;1

penicillamine-related lichenoid dermatitis and utility of zinc acetate in a wilson disease patient with hepatic presentation, anxiety and spect abnormalities.;"wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper metabolism with consequent copper accumulation and toxicity in many tissues and consequent hepatic, neurologic and psychiatric disorders. we report a case of wilson's disease with chronic liver disease; moreover, in our patient, presenting also with high levels of state anxiety without depression, 99mtc-ecd-spect showed cortical hypoperfusion in frontal lobes, more marked on the left frontal lobe. during the follow-up of our patient, penicillamine was interrupted after the appearance of a lichenoid dermatitis, and zinc acetate permitted to continue the successful treatment of the patient without side-effects. in our case the therapy with zinc acetate represented an effective treatment for a wilson's disease patient in which penicillamine-related side effects appeared. the safety of the zinc acetate allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs; this observation is in line with the growing evidence on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of wilson's disease. since most of wilson's disease penicillamine-treated patients do not seem to develop this skin lesion, it could be conceivable that a specific genetic factor is involved in drug response. further studies are needed for a better clarification of wilson's disease therapy, and in particular to differentiate specific therapies for different wilson's disease phenotypes.";0;1;1;0

potential deleterious effect of furosemide in radiocontrast nephropathy.;the purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy. 18 patients, referred to a radiocontrast study, considered at risk because of preexisting renal insufficiency, were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, performed at the secondary care center of a 1,100-bed private university hospital. in addition to fluids, the treatment group received furosemide (mean dose 110 mg) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material. the control group received fluids (mean 3 liters). radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non-ionic contrast material, at an average dose of 245 ml. renal function significantly deteriorated in the group pretreated with furosemide (p < 0.005 by anova), with a rise in serum creatinine from 145 +/- 13 to 182 +/- 16 mumol/l at 24 h, while no change occurred in the control group (from 141 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 7 mumol/l). renal failure was associated with weight loss in the furosemide-treated group. furosemide may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy.;0;1;0;0
doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity monitored by ecg in freely moving mice. a new model to test potential protectors.;in laboratory animals, histology is most commonly used to study doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. however, for monitoring during treatment, large numbers of animals are needed. recently we developed a new method to measure ecg values in freely moving mice by telemetry. with this model we investigated the effect of chronic doxorubicin administration on the ecg of freely moving balb/c mice and the efficacy of icrf-187 as a protective agent. the st interval significantly widened from 15.0 +/- 1.5 to 56.8 +/- 11.8 ms in week 10 (7 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 3 weeks of observation). the ecg of the control animals did not change during the entire study. after sacrifice the hearts of doxorubicin-treated animals were enlarged and the atria were hypertrophic. as this schedule exerted more toxicity than needed to investigate protective agents, the protection of icrf-187 was determined using a dose schedule with lower general toxicity (6 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 2 weeks of observation). on this schedule, the animals' hearts appeared normal after sacrifice and icrf-187 (50 mg/kg given i.p. 1 h before doxorubicin) provided almost full protection. these data were confirmed by histology. the results indicate that this new model is very sensitive and enables monitoring of the development of cardiotoxicity with time. these findings result in a model that allows the testing of protectors against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity as demonstrated by the protection provided by icrf-187.;1;0;1;0

isolation of the gene for mcleod syndrome that encodes a novel membrane transport protein.;mcleod syndrome is an x-linked multisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems . we have assembled a cosmid contig of 360 kb that encompasses the mcleod gene locus . a 50 kb deletion was detected by screening dna from patients with radiolabeled whole cosmids , and two transcription units were identified within this deletion . the mrna expression pattern of one of them , designated as xk , correlates closely to the mcleod phenotype . xk encodes a novel protein with structural characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane transport proteins . nucleotide sequence analysis of xk from two unrelated mcleod patients has identified point mutations at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites . these findings provide direct evidence that xk is responsible for mcleod syndrome . .;0;0;1;0
regional localisation of the friedreich ataxia locus to human chromosome 9q13----q21.;"1. we have previously assigned the friedreich ataxia locus ( frda ) to chromosome 9 ; the current maximal lod score between frda and mct112 ( d9s15 ) is greater than 50 at a recombination fraction of theta = 0 . the physical assignment of the locus defined by mct112 , and hence frda , has not been determined , although linkage analysis of mct112 with other chromosome 9 markers inferred a location close to the centromere . we have used in situ hybridisation with mct112 , a corresponding cosmid mj1 , and dr47 ( d9s5 ) , coupled with mapping studies on hybrid cell panels , to define more precisely the location of the disease locus . the in situ location of all three probes is 9q13----q21 . 1 , distal to the variable heterochromatin region . physical assignment of frda will allow us to identify hybrid cell lines containing the mutated gene .";0;0;1;0
atm-dependent phosphorylation of nibrin in response to radiation exposure.;mutations in the gene atm are responsible for the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia ( a-t ) , which is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction , radiosensitivity , chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition . both the a-t phenotype and the similarity of the atm protein to other dna-damage sensors suggests a role for atm in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition , signalling and repair of dna double-strand breaks ( dsbs ) . there are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity , chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in a-t patients and that in patients with nijmegen breakage syndrome ( nbs ) . the protein defective in nbs , nibrin ( encoded by nbs1 ) , forms a complex with mre11 and rad50 ( refs 1 , 2 ) . this complex localizes to dsbs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation ( ir ) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time . the overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in a-t and nbs suggests that atm and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway . here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of cells with ir . this response is abrogated in a-t cells that either do not express atm protein or express near full-length mutant protein . we also show that atm physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro . phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because mutated nibrin ( s343a ) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in nbs cells . atm phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin-mre11-rad50 association as revealed by radiation-induced foci formation . our data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in phenotype between a-t and nbs . .;0;0;1;1

effect of some anticancer drugs and combined chemotherapy on renal toxicity.;the nephrotoxic action of anticancer drugs such as nitrogranulogen (ng), methotrexate (mtx), 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) and cyclophosphamide (cy) administered alone or in combination [mtx + 5-fu + cy (cmf)] was evaluated in experiments on wistar rats. after drug administration, creatinine concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined, as well as creatinine clearance. histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed. after mtx administration a significant increase (p = 0.0228) in the plasma creatinine concentration and a significant (p = 0.0001) decrease in creatinine clearance was noted compared to controls. after the administration of ng, 5-fu and cy neither a statistically significant increase in creatinine concentration nor an increase in creatinine clearance was observed compared to the group receiving no cytostatics. following polytherapy according to the cmf regimen, a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.0343) in creatinine clearance was found, but creatinine concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls. cy caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats, but it did not cause this complication when combined with 5-fu and mtx. histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of mtx, cy and ng, while no such change was observed after 5-fu and joint administration of mtx + 5-fu + cy compared to controls. our studies indicate that nephrotoxicity of mtx + 5-fu + cy administered jointly is lower than in monotherapy.;0;1;0;1

co-carcinogenic effect of retinyl acetate on forestomach carcinogenesis of male f344 rats induced with butylated hydroxyanisole.;the potential modifying effect of retinyl acetate (ra) on butylated hydroxyanisole (bha)-induced rat forestomach tumorigenesis was examined. male f344 rats, 5 weeks of age, were maintained on diet containing 1% or 2% bha by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with ra at various concentrations (w/v) for 52 weeks. in groups given 2% bha, although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals, co-administration of 0.25% ra significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the incidence of forestomach tumors (squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma) to 60% (9/15, 2 rats with carcinoma) from 15% (3/20, one rat with carcinoma) in the group given ra-free water. in rats given 1% bha, ra co-administered at a dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.25% showed a dose-dependent enhancing effect on the development of the bha-induced epithelial hyperplasia. tumors, all papillomas, were induced in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% ra and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% ra co-administration. ra alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach. these findings indicate that ra acted as a co-carcinogen in the bha forestomach carcinogenesis of the rat.;0;0;0;1

acute vocal fold palsy after acute disulfiram intoxication.;acute peripheral neuropathy caused by a disulfiram overdose is very rare and there is no report of it leading to vocal fold palsy. a 49-year-old woman was transferred to our department because of quadriparesis, lancinating pain, sensory loss, and paresthesia of the distal limbs. one month previously, she had taken a single high dose of disulfiram (130 tablets of alcohol stop tab, shin-poong pharm. co., ansan, korea) in a suicide attempt. she was not an alcoholic. for the first few days after ingestion, she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate ataxia and giddiness. she noticed hoarseness and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state. a nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. laryngeal electromyography (thyroarytenoid muscle) showed ample denervation potentials. laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation. her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer. this was a case of acute palsy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and superimposed severe acute sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy caused by high-dose disulfiram intoxication.;0;0;1;0
experimental cyclosporine nephrotoxicity: risk of concomitant chemotherapy.;the role of cyclosporine (csa) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rats. administration of 20 mg/kg/day csa for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man. the combined administration of csa and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential, such as gentamicin (at therapeutic doses), amphothericin b and ketoconazole, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the csa induced toxicity in the rat model. gentamicin at toxic doses, however, increased csa nephrotoxicity. thus, the nephrotoxicity induced by csa has a different pathogenetic mechanism.;0;1;0;0

clinical evaluation of adverse effects during bepridil administration for atrial fibrillation and flutter.;background: bepridil hydrochloride (bpd) has attracted attention as an effective drug for atrial fibrillation (af) and atrial flutter (afl). however, serious adverse effects, including torsade de pointes (tdp), have been reported. methods and results: adverse effects of bpd requiring discontinuation of treatment were evaluated. bpd was administered to 459 patients (361 males, 63+/-12 years old) comprising 378 af and 81 afl cases. mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension (lad) were 66+/-11% and 40+/-6 mm, respectively. adverse effects were observed in 19 patients (4%) during an average follow-up of 20 months. there was marked qt prolongation greater than 0.55 s in 13 patients, bradycardia less than 40 beats/min in 6 patients, dizziness and general fatigue in 1 patient each. in 4 of 13 patients with qt prolongation, tdp occurred. the major triggering factors of tdp were hypokalemia and sudden decrease in heart rate. there were no differences in the clinical backgrounds of the patients with and without tdp other than lad and age, which were larger and older in the patients with tdp. conclusion: careful observation of serum potassium concentration and the ecg should always be done during bpd administration, particularly in elderly patients.;1;0;0;0
choroideremia: close linkage to dxys1 and dxys12 demonstrated by segregation analysis and historical-genealogical evidence.;linkage studies using restriction fragment length polymorphisms were conducted in the x-linked disorder , choroideremia , designated tcd for progressive tapeto-choroidal dystrophy . previously demonstrated close linkage with locus dxys1 was confirmed ( lod 11 . 44 at 0 recombination distance ) . in addition , locus dxys12 was found to be closely linked with tcd ( lod 3 . 31 at 0 recombination distance ) . the disease mainly occurs in three large kindreds in remote northern finland . while formal genealogical proof is lacking , all presently living ( more than 80 affected males and 120 carrier females ) probably originate from a common founder couple born in 1644 and 1646 , twelve generations ago . all 36 patients and 48 carriers tested from the three kindreds had the same haplotype ( tcd / dxys1 , 11kb / dxys12 , 1 . 6kb ) . given that at least 105 female meioses transmitting tcd have occurred since 1650 in these kindreds , extremely close linkage between tcd , dxys1 and dxys12 is suggested . the above haplotype is a very useful diagnostic tool in these tcd families . we suggest that our historical-genealogical approach to linkage analysis may be possible elsewhere in similar isolated populations;0;0;1;0

clarithromycin-associated visual hallucinations in a patient with chronic renal failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.;visual hallucinations are a rare event in chronic renal failure and not related to uremia per se. unreported in the literature is visual hallucinations occurring in association with the new macrolide antibiotic, clarithromycin. we describe such a case in a patient with end-stage renal disease (esrd) maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd). the combination of a relatively high dose of clarithromycin in face of chronic renal failure in a functionally anephric patient, with underlying aluminum intoxication, may have facilitated the appearance of this neurotoxic side effect. it is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of medications in face of chronic renal failure, the possibility of drug interactions, and how these factors should help guide medication therapy in the esrd patient.;0;1;1;0

beta-catenin accumulation and mutation of the ctnnb1 gene in hepatoblastoma.;hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant tumor of the liver that occurs in children at an average age of 2 to 3 years . epidemiologic studies have shown an increased frequency of this tumor type in families affected by adenomatous polyposis coli . in addition to the epidemiologic data , molecular genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the apc tumor suppressor may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis . a major function of apc is the downregulation of beta-catenin , a transcription-activating protein with oncogenic potential . in an ongoing immunohistochemical study of beta-catenin expression in sporadic cases of tumor types that are associated with adenomatous polyposis coli , we observed increased beta-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of three investigated hepatoblastomas . sequencing of exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene ( ctnnb1 ) revealed an activating mutation in one of the tumor samples . our data indicate for the first time that beta-catenin accumulation may play a role in the development of hepatoblastoma and that activating mutations of the beta-catenin gene may substitute biallelic apc inactivation in this tumor type . genes chromosomes cancer 25  399-402 , 1999 . .;0;1;0;1

color vision defects in adrenomyeloneuropathy.;the relationship between abnormal color vision and adrenomyeloneuropathy ( amn ) was investigated in 27 amn patients and 31 age-matched controls by using the farnsworth-munsell 100 hue test . twelve ( 44 % ) of 27 patients showed test scores significantly above normal . the axes of bipolarity determined by the testing differed widely between the patients with abnormal scores , compatible with the notion that different alterations in visual pigment genes occur in different amn kindreds . these observations confirm our earlier impression that the frequency of abnormal color vision is increased in these kindreds , and it supports our contentions that ( 1 ) amn ( and its companion , adrenoleukodystrophy ) are very closely linked to the visual pigment loci at xq28 and ( 2 ) this proximity might provide the opportunity to observe contiguous gene defects . .;0;0;1;0

linezolid-induced optic neuropathy.;many systemic antimicrobials have been implicated to cause ocular adverse effects. this is especially relevant in multidrug therapy where more than one drug can cause a similar ocular adverse effect. we describe a case of progressive loss of vision associated with linezolid therapy. a 45-year-old male patient who was on treatment with multiple second-line anti-tuberculous drugs including linezolid and ethambutol for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (xdr-tb) presented to us with painless progressive loss of vision in both eyes. color vision was defective and fundus examination revealed optic disc edema in both eyes. ethambutol-induced toxic optic neuropathy was suspected and tablet ethambutol was withdrawn. deterioration of vision occurred despite withdrawal of ethambutol. discontinuation of linezolid resulted in marked improvement of vision. our report emphasizes the need for monitoring of visual function in patients on long-term linezolid treatment.;0;0;1;0
effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the sphincter of oddi spasm evoked by prostigmine-morphine administration.;"objective: in this study the effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the prostigmine-morphine-induced sphincter of oddi spasm was evaluated in nine female patients with sphincter of oddi dyskinesia. method: sphincter of oddi spasm was induced by prostigmine-morphine administration (0.5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. the entire procedure was repeated during glyceryl trinitrate infusion (nitrolingual 1 microg/kg/min for 120 min). results: prostigmine-morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (tmax) over the hepatic hilum (hh: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (cbd: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (t1/2) over the liver parenchyma (lp: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), hh (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and cbd (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of oddi. glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely normalized the prostigmine-morphine-induced alterations in these quantitative parameters (tmax over the lp: 11.33 +/- 1.13; over the hh: 18.88 +/- 1.48; and over the cbd: 36.22 +/- 1.92; and t1/2 over the lp: 28.21 +/- 1.83; over the hh: 33.42 +/- 3.10; and over the cbd: 41.66 +/- 6.33), suggesting an effective sphincter-relaxing effect of glyceryl trinitrate. conclusion: these results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine-induced sphincter of oddi spasm in humans. since glyceryl trinitrate is able to overcome even the drastic effect of morphine, it might be of relevance in the treatment of sphincter of oddi dyskinesia.";0;1;0;0
antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of birth defects: national birth defects prevention study.;"objective: to estimate the association between antibacterial medications and selected birth defects. design, setting, and participants: population-based, multisite, case-control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major birth defects identified via birth defect surveillance programs in 10 states (n = 13 155) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions (n = 4941). main exposure: reported maternal use of antibacterials (1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester). main outcome measure: odds ratios (ors) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected birth defects adjusted for potential confounders. results: the reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy, peaking during the third month. sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly (adjusted or [aor] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.3-8.8), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (aor = 3.2; 95% ci, 1.3-7.6), coarctation of the aorta (aor = 2.7; 95% ci, 1.3-5.6), choanal atresia (aor = 8.0; 95% ci, 2.7-23.5), transverse limb deficiency (aor = 2.5; 95% ci, 1.0-5.9), and diaphragmatic hernia (aor = 2.4; 95% ci, 1.1-5.4). nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos (aor = 3.7; 95% ci, 1.1-12.2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (aor = 4.2; 95% ci, 1.9-9.1), atrial septal defects (aor = 1.9; 95% ci, 1.1-3.4), and cleft lip with cleft palate (aor = 2.1; 95% ci, 1.2-3.9). other antibacterial agents that showed associations included erythromycins (2 defects), penicillins (1 defect), cephalosporins (1 defect), and quinolones (1 defect). conclusions: reassuringly, penicillins, erythromycins, and cephalosporins, although used commonly by pregnant women, were not associated with many birth defects. sulfonamides and nitrofurantoins were associated with several birth defects, indicating a need for additional scrutiny.";1;0;1;0
protective effect of a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist, bn 52021, on bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular impairments in rats.;administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine (1.5 or 2 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial blood pressure (mbp) and heart rate (hr) leading to death (in 67% or 90% of animals respectively). intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (paf) antagonist bn 52021 (10 mg/kg), 30 min before bupivacaine administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of mbp and hr. in contrast, doses of 1 mg/kg bn 52021 given 30 min before or 10 mg/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of bupivacaine were ineffective. when bn 52021 (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after bupivacaine (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of mbp and hr was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective. a partial recovery of bupivacaine-induced ecg alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with bn 52021. since the administration of bn 52021, at all doses studied, did not alter mbp and hr at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of bn 52021, a specific antagonist of paf, against bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity. thus, consistent with its direct effect on heart, paf appears to be implicated in bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular alterations.;1;0;0;0
protective effect of misoprostol on indomethacin induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients.;objective: to evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with indomethacin. methods: forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaid) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin, 150 mg/day (group a), or indomethacin 150 mg/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg/day (group b). laboratory variables of renal function [serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (bun) and electrolytes] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days, until termination of the study (a period of at least 6 days). response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain. results: forty-two patients completed the study, 22 in group a and 20 in group b. bun and creatinine increased by > 50% of baseline levels in 54 and 45% of group a patients, respectively, compared to only 20 and 10% of group b patients (p < 0.05). potassium (k) increment of 0.6 meq/l or more was observed in 50% of group a, but in only 15% of group b patients (p < 0.05). the mean increments in bun, creatinine, and k were reduced by 63, 80, and 42%, respectively, in group b patients compared to group a. response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. conclusion: hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal dysfunction. addition of misoprostol can minimize this renal impairment without affecting pain control.;0;1;0;0
paclitaxel combined with carboplatin in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.;"in a phase i study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel (taxol; bristol-myers squibb company, princeton, nj) given as a 3-hour infusion in combination with carboplatin administered every 21 days to women with advanced ovarian cancer, paclitaxel doses were escalated as follows: level 1, 135 mg/m2; level 2, 160 mg/m2; level 3, 185 mg/m2; and level 4,210 mg/m2. the fixed dose of carboplatin at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration-time curve (auc) of 5 using the calvert formula. in levels 5 and 6 the carboplatin dose was targeted at aucs of 6 and 7.5, respectively, combined with a fixed paclitaxel dose of 185 mg/m2. to date, 30 previously untreated patients, all with a good performance status (eastern cooperative oncology group 0 to 2) have been entered into this ongoing study. the dose-limiting toxicity of the combination was myelosuppression (leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia). neurotoxicity was largely moderate. so far, 14 patients are evaluable for response; of these, eight (57%) showed objective (complete or partial) response and disease stabilized in six patients. no patient had disease progression. we conclude that the combination of paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour infusion followed immediately by a 1-hour infusion of carboplatin at an auc of 6 can be administered safely in a 21-day schedule in the outpatient setting. the recommended dose for phase iii studies is paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 and carboplatin auc 6.";0;0;1;1

a comparison of glyceryl trinitrate with diclofenac for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea: an open, randomized, cross-over trial.;"primary dysmenorrhea is a syndrome characterized by painful uterine contractility caused by a hypersecretion of endometrial prostaglandins; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first choice for its treatment. however, in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that myometrial cells are also targets of the relaxant effects of nitric oxide (no). the aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of glyceryl trinitrate (gtn), an no donor, in the resolution of primary dysmenorrhea in comparison with diclofenac (dcf). a total of 24 patients with the diagnosis of severe primary dysmenorrhea were studied during two consecutive menstrual cycles. in an open, cross-over, controlled design, patients were randomized to receive either dcf per os or gtn patches the first days of menses, when menstrual cramps became unendurable. in the subsequent cycle the other treatment was used. patients received up to 3 doses/day of 50 mg dcf or 2.5 mg/24 h transdermal gtn for the first 3 days of the cycle, according to their needs. the participants recorded menstrual symptoms and possible side-effects at different times (0, 30, 60, 120 minutes) after the first dose of medication on the first day of the cycle, with both drugs. the difference in pain intensity score (dpi) was the main outcome variable. both treatments significantly reduced dpi by the 30th minute (gtn, -12.8 +/- 17.9; dcf, -18.9 +/- 16.6). however, dcf continued to be effective in reducing pelvic pain for two hours, whereas gtn scores remained more or less stable after 30 min and significantly higher than those for dfc (after one hour: gtn, -12.8 +/- 17.9; dfc, -18.9 +/- 16.6 and after two hours: gtn, -23.7 +/- 20.5; dfc, -59.7 +/- 17.9, p = 0.0001). low back pain was also relieved by both drugs. headache was significantly increased by gtn but not by dcf. eight patients stopped using gtn because headache--attributed to its use--became intolerable. these findings indicate that gtn has a reduced efficacy and tolerability by comparison with dcf in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.";0;0;1;0

incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type ii and postoperative recovery of platelet count in liver graft recipients: a retrospective cohort analysis.;background: thrombocytopenia in patients with end-stage liver disease is a common disorder caused mainly by portal hypertension, low levels of thrombopoetin, and endotoxemia. the impact of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type ii (hit type ii) as a cause of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation is not yet understood, with few literature citations reporting contradictory results. the aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical hit type ii. method: we retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full-size liver transplantation between january 2006 and december 2010 due to end-stage or malignant liver disease. preoperative platelet count, postoperative course of platelets, and clinical signs of hit type ii were analyzed. results: a total of 155 (75.6%) of 205 patients had thrombocytopenia before transplantation, significantly influenced by model of end-stage liver disease score and liver cirrhosis. the platelet count exceeded 100,000/ul in most of the patients (n = 193) at a medium of 7 d. regarding hit ii, there were four (1.95%) patients with a background of hit type ii. conclusions: the incidence of hit in patients with end-stage hepatic failure is, with about 1.95%, rare. for further reduction of hit type ii, the use of intravenous heparin should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low-molecular-weight heparin after normalization of platelet count.;1;1;0;0

normoammonemic encephalopathy: solely valproate induced or multiple mechanisms?;a 77-year-old woman presented with subacute onset progressive confusion, aggression, auditory hallucinations and delusions. in the preceding months, the patient had a number of admissions with transient unilateral hemiparesis with facial droop, and had been started on valproate for presumed hemiplegic migraine. valproate was withdrawn soon after admission and her cognitive abilities have gradually improved over 3 months of follow-up. valproate levels taken prior to withdrawal were subtherapeutic and the patient was normoammonaemic. eeg undertaken during inpatient stay showed changes consistent with encephalopathy, and low titre n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antibodies were present in this patient. the possible aetiologies of valproate-induced encephalopathy and nmda receptor-associated encephalitis present a diagnostic dilemma. we present a putative combinatorial hypothesis to explain this patient's symptoms.;0;0;1;0

experimental progressive muscular dystrophy and its treatment with high doses anabolizing agents.;"we are still a long way from discovering an unequivocal pathogenetic interpretation of progressive muscular dystrophy in man. noteworthy efforts have been made in the experimental field; a recessive autosomic form found in the mouse seems to bear the closest resemblance to the human form from the genetic point of view. myopathy due to lack of vitamin e and myopathy induced by certain viruses have much in common anatomically and pathologically with the human form. the authors induced myodystrophy in the rat by giving it a diet lacking in vitamin e. the pharmacological characteristics of vitamin e and the degenerative changes brought about by its deficiency, especially in the muscles, are illustrated. it is thus confirmed that the histological characteristics of myopathic rat muscle induced experimentally are extraordinarily similar to those of human myopathy as confirmed during biopsies performed at the orthopaedic traumatological centre, florence. the encouraging results obtained in various authoratative departments in myopathic patients by using anabolizing steroids have encouraged the authors to investigate the beneficial effects of one anabolizing agent (dianabol, ciba) at high doses in rats rendered myopathic by a diet deficient in vitamin e. in this way they obtained appreciable changes in body weight (increased from 50 to 70 g after forty days at a dose of 5 mg per day of anabolizing agent), but most of all they found histological changes due to ""regenerative"" changes in the muscle tissue, which however maintained its myopathic characteristics in the control animals that were not treated with the anabolizing agent. the authors conclude by affirming the undoubted efficacy of the anabolizing steroids in experimental myopathic disease, but they have reservations as to the transfer of the results into the human field, where high dosage cannot be carried out continuously because of the effects of the drug on virility; because the tissue injury too often occurs at an irreversible stage vis-a-vis the ""regeneration"" of the muscle tissue; and finally because the dystrophic injurious agent is certainly not the lack of vitamin e but something as yet unknown.";0;0;1;0
reduced cardiotoxicity and preserved antitumor efficacy of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide compared with conventional doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in a randomized, multicenter trial of metastatic breast cancer.;"purpose: to determine whether myocet (liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin; the liposome company, elan corporation, princeton, nj) in combination with cyclophosphamide significantly reduces doxorubicin cardiotoxicity while providing comparable antitumor efficacy in first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer (mbc). patients and methods: two hundred ninety-seven patients with mbc and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg/m(2) of myocet (m) or conventional doxorubicin (a), in combination with 600 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide (c), every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. cardiotoxicity was defined by reductions in left-ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans, or congestive heart failure (chf). antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective tumor response rates (world health organization criteria), time to progression, and survival. results: six percent of mc patients versus 21% (including five cases of chf) of ac patients developed cardiotoxicity (p =.0002). median cumulative doxorubicin dose at onset was more than 2,220 mg/m(2) for mc versus 480 mg/m(2) for ac (p =.0001, hazard ratio, 5.04). mc patients also experienced less grade 4 neutropenia. antitumor efficacy of mc versus ac was comparable: objective response rates, 43% versus 43%; median time to progression, 5.1% versus 5.5 months; median time to treatment failure, 4.6 versus 4.4 months; and median survival, 19 versus 16 months. conclusion: myocet improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by significantly reducing cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy for mbc.";1;0;0;1

human and canine ventricular vasoactive intestinal polypeptide: decrease with heart failure.;"vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip) is a systemic and coronary vasodilator that may have positive inotropic properties. myocardial levels of vip were assayed before and after the development of heart failure in two canine models. in the first, cobalt cardiomyopathy was induced in eight dogs; vip (by radioimmunoassay) decreased from 35 +/- 11 pg/mg protein (mean +/- sd) to 5 +/- 4 pg/mg protein (p less than 0.05). in six dogs with doxorubicin-induced heart failure, vip decreased from 31 +/- 7 to 11 +/- 4 pg/mg protein (p less than 0.05). in addition, vip content of left ventricular muscle of resected failing hearts in 10 patients receiving a heart transplant was compared with the papillary muscles in 14 patients (five with rheumatic disease, nine with myxomatous degeneration) receiving mitral valve prostheses. the lowest myocardial vip concentration was found in the hearts of patients with coronary disease (one patient receiving a transplant and three receiving mitral prostheses) (6.3 +/- 1.9 pg/mg protein). the other patients undergoing transplantation had an average ejection fraction of 17% +/- 6% and a vip level of 8.8 +/- 3.9 pg/mg protein. the hearts without coronary artery disease (average ejection fraction of this group 62% +/- 10%) had a vip concentration of 14.1 +/- 7.9 pg/mg protein, and this was greater than in hearts of the patients with coronary disease and the hearts of patients receiving a transplant (p less than 0.05). myocardial catecholamines were also determined in 14 subjects; a weak correlation (r = 0.57, p less than 0.05) between the tissue concentrations of vip and norepinephrine was noted.(abstract truncated at 250 words)";1;0;0;0

mice lacking the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase develop a late onset progressive myopathy.;myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a ctg repeat in the 3 untranslated region of a putative protein kinase ( dmpk ) . to elucidate the role of dmpk in dm pathogenesis we have developed dmpk deficient ( dmpk- / - ) mice . dmpk- / -mice develop a late-onset , progressive skeletal myopathy that shares some pathological features with dm . muscles from mature mice show variation in fibre size , increased fibre degeneration and fibrosis . adult dmpk- / -mice show ultrastructural changes in muscle and a 50 % decrease in force generation compared to young mice . our results indicate that dmpk may be necessary for the maintenance of skeletal muscle structure and function and suggest that a decrease in dmpk levels may contribute to dm pathology . .;0;0;1;0
disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after amiodarone treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha target gene activation.;amiodarone, an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent, has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients. to gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect, mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation. amiodarone induced hepatomegaly, hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation, and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and glucose. northern blot analysis of hepatic rna revealed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation, lipoprotein assembly, and lipid transport. many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (pparalpha), a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor. the absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in pparalpha knockout [pparalpha-/-] mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional pparalpha gene. compared to wild-type mice, treatment of pparalpha-/- mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss. the inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse pparalpha transiently expressed in human hepg2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect. based upon these results, we conclude that amiodarone disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of pparalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect. these results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepatotoxic effects of amiodarone and indicate that pparalpha protects against amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity.;0;1;0;0

abnormal high density lipoproteins in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.;the plasma lipoprotein profiles and high density lipoproteins ( hdl ) were characterized in patients with the genetic disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( ctx ) . abnormalities in the hdl may contribute to their increased atherogenesis and excessive deposits of tissue sterols in the presence of low or low-normal concentrations of plasma cholesterol ( 165 + / - 25 mg / dl ) and low density lipoproteins ( ldl ) . the mean hdl-cholesterol concentration in the ctx plasmas was 14 . 5 + / - 3 . 2 mg / dl , about one-third the normal value . the low hdl-cholesterol reflects a low concentration and an abnormal lipid composition of the plasma hdl . relative to normal hdl , the cholesteryl esters are low , free cholesterol and phospholipids essentially normal , and triglycerides increased . the ratio of apoprotein ( apo ) to total cholesterol in the hdl of ctx was two to three times greater than normal . in the ctx hdl , the ratio of apoai to apoaii was high , the proportion of apoc low , and a normally minor form of apoai increased relative to other forms . the hdl in electron micrographs appeared normal morphologically and in particle size . the abnormalities in lipoprotein distribution profile and composition of the plasma hdl result from metabolic defects that are not understood but may be linked to the genetic defect in bile acid synthesis in ctx . as a consequence , it is probable that the normal functions of the hdl , possibly including modulation of ldl-cholesterol uptake and the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues , are perturbed significantly in this disease .;0;0;1;0

high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for pediatric mri.;objective: this large-scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of dexmedetomidine. aim: to determine the hemodynamic responses, efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging (mri) studies. background: dexmedetomidine has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies. over time, an effective protocol utilizing high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative agent has evolved. methods/materials: as part of the ongoing quality assurance process, data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed. data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received dexmedetomidine for mri sedation from april 2005 to april 2007. results: since 2005, the 10-min loading dose of our dexmedetomidine protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg.kg(-1), and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1.5 to 2 microg.kg(-1).h(-1). the current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation (able to complete the imaging study) when using dexmedetomidine alone from 91.8% to 97.6% (p = 0.009), reducing the requirement for adjuvant pentobarbital in the event of sedation failure with dexmedetomidine alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min (p < 0.001). although dexmedetomidine sedation was associated with a 16% incidence of bradycardia, all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20% of age-adjusted normal range and oxygen saturations were 95% or higher. conclusion: dexmedetomidine in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric mri studies. while use of high dose dexmedetomidine is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established 'awake' norms, this deviation is generally within 20% of norms, and is not associated with adverse sequelae. dexmedetomidine is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric mri.;1;0;1;0

increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha-hydroxylation of deoxycholic acid in ethinyl estradiol-induced cholestasis in rats.;deoxycholic acid conjugation, transport capacity, and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid, and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment. during [24-14c]sodium deoxycholate infusion, [14c]biliary bile acid secretion increased, but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. ethinyl estradiol-treated animals excreted significantly less 14c as taurocholic acid than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha-hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid. ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid, but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (p less than 0.01). these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species. furthermore, the rat converts deoxycholic acid, a poor choleretic, to taurocholic acid, a good choleretic. when this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment, sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid.;0;1;0;0

acute effects of n-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine-induced seizure in rats.;the present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and gaba) of n-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (vpu) in comparison to its parent compound, valproic acid (vpa). vpu was more potent than vpa, exhibiting the median effective dose (ed(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for vpa was 322 mg/kg. in vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and gaba. pretreatment with either vpu (50 and 100 mg/kg) or vpa (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. in addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of gaba and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level. based on the finding that vpu and vpa could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate. therefore, like vpa, the finding that vpu could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals. some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated.;0;0;1;0

understanding the molecular basis of fragile x syndrome.;fragile x syndrome , a common form of inherited mental retardation , is mainly caused by massive expansion of cgg triplet repeats located in the 5-untranslated region of the fragile x mental retardation-1 ( fmr1 ) gene . in patients with fragile x syndrome , the expanded cgg triplet repeats are hypermethylated and the expression of the fmr1 gene is repressed , which leads to the absence of fmr1 protein ( fmrp ) and subsequent mental retardation . fmrp is an rna-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm . this protein has been implicated in protein translation as it is found associated with polyribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum . we discuss here the recent progress made towards understanding the molecular mechanism of cgg repeat expansion and physiological function ( s ) of fmrp . these studies will not only help to illuminate the molecular basis of the general class of human diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion but also provide an avenue to understand aspects of human cognition and intelligence . .;0;0;1;0

acetaminophen-induced hypotension.;through 30 years of widespread use, acetaminophen has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages. the potential for acetaminophen to produce cardiovascular toxicities is very low. however, acetaminophen has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of anaphylaxis, including hypotension, in sensitive individuals. this article describes two critically ill patients in whom transient episodes of hypotension reproducibly developed after administration of acetaminophen. other symptoms of allergic reactions were not clinically detectable. the hypotensive episodes were severe enough to require vasopressor administration. the reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider acetaminophen in patients with hypotension of unknown origin.;1;0;1;0

enhanced bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid.;high doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba). in the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose-urethane. isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol. enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised. these results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with gabaergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone. such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.;0;0;1;0

case report: acute unintentional carbachol intoxication.;"introduction: intoxications with carbachol, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare. we report an interesting case investigating a (near) fatal poisoning. methods: the son of an 84-year-old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in alzheimer's disease. the mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound 'carbamylcholin'; that is, carbachol. he bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by hplc-mass spectrometry. results: minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. bradycardia, cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred. initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. on hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmhg. further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. high doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and dopamine were necessary. the patient was extubated 1 week later. however, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. one week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. on the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure. serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg/l carbachol, respectively. the corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg/l. conclusion: this case started with a media report in a popular newspaper, initiated by published, peer-reviewed research on herbals, and involved human failure in a case history, medical examination and clinical treatment. for the first time, an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been developed. the analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260. especially in old patients, intensivists should consider intoxications (with cholinergics) as a cause of acute cardiovascular failure.";1;1;1;0
acute interstitial nephritis due to nicergoline (sermion).;we report a case of acute interstitial nephritis (ain) due to nicergoline (sermion). a 50-year-old patient admitted to our hospital for fever and acute renal failure. before admission, he had been taking nicergoline and bendazac lysine due to retinal vein occlusion at ophthalmologic department. thereafter, he experienced intermittent fever and skin rash. on admission, clinical symptoms (i.e. arthralgia and fever) and laboratory findings (i.e. eosinophilia and renal failure) suggested ain, and which was confirmed by pathologic findings on renal biopsy. a lymphocyte transformation test demonstrated a positive result against nicergoline. treatment was consisted of withdrawal of nicergoline and intravenous methylprednisolone, and his renal function was completely recovered. to our knowledge, this is the first report of nicergoline-associated ain.;0;1;1;0
human complement factor h deficiency associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome.;this study reports on six cases of deficiency in the human complement regulatory protein factor h ( fh ) in the context of an acute renal disease . five of the cases were observed in children presenting with idiopathic hemolytic uremic syndrome ( hus ) . two of the children exhibited a homozygous deficiency characterized by the absence of the 150-kd form of factor h and the presence , upon immunoblotting , of the 42-kd factor h-like protein 1 ( fhl-1 ) and other fh-related protein ( fhr ) bands . southern blot and pcr analysis of dna of one patient with homozygous deficiency ruled out the presence of a large deletion of the fh gene as the underlying defect for the deficiency . the other four children presented with heterozygous deficiency and exhibited a normal immunoblotting pattern of proteins of the fh family . factor h deficiency is the only complement deficiency associated with hus . these observations suggest a role for fh and / or fh receptors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic hus . .;0;1;0;0

pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in patients with cimetidine-associated mental confusion.;"15 cases of cimetidine-associated mental confusion have been reported. in order that this syndrome might be investigated changes in mental status (m.s.) were correlated with serum concentrations and renal and hepatic function in 36 patients, 30 patients had no m.s. change on cimetidine and 6 had moderate to severe changes. these 6 patients had both renal and liver dysfunction (p less than 0.05), as well as cimetidine trough-concentrations of more than 1.25 microgram/ml (p less than 0.05). the severity of m.s. changes increased as trough-concentrations rose, 5 patients had lumbar puncture. the cerebrospinal fluid: serum ratio of cimetidine concentrations was 0.24:1 and indicates that cimetidine passes the blood-brain barrier; it also raises the possibility that m.s. changes are due to blockade of histamine h2-receptors in the central nervous system. patients likely to have both raised trough-concentrations and mental confusion are those with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction. they should be closely observed and should be given reduced doses of cimetidine.";0;1;1;0

severe complications of antianginal drug therapy in a patient identified as a poor metabolizer of metoprolol, propafenone, diltiazem, and sparteine.;a 47-year-old patient suffering from coronary artery disease was admitted to the ccu in shock with iii. av block, severe hypotension, and impairment of ventricular function. one week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of metoprolol (100 mg t.i.d. and then 100 mg b.i.d.) had been initiated. two days before admission diltiazem (60 mg b.i.d.) was prescribed in addition. analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol (greater than 3000 ng/ml) and diltiazem (526 ng/ml). the patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy. three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol, diltiazem, propafenone (since he had received this drug in the past), and sparteine (as a probe for the debrisoquine/sparteine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism). it was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs, indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control. therefore, patients belonging to the poor-metabolizer phenotype of sparteine/debrisoquine polymorphism in drug metabolism, which constitutes 6.4% of the german population, may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone. moreover, the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients.;1;0;0;0

protection against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity toward striatal dopamine neurons in rodents by ly274614, an excitatory amino acid antagonist.;"ly274614, 3sr,4ars,6sr,8ars-6-[phosphonomethyl]decahydr oisoquinoline-3- carboxylic acid, has been described as a potent antagonist of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) subtype of glutamate receptor. here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole-treated rats is reported. a single 18.4 mg/kg (i.p.) dose of (+/-)-amphetamine hemisulfate, given to rats pretreated with iprindole, resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later. this prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine (mk-801, a non-competitive antagonist of nmda receptors) or by ly274614 (a competitive antagonist of nmda receptors). the protective effect of ly274614 was dose-dependent, being maximum at 10-40 mgkg (i.p.). a 10 mg/kg dose of ly274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum, when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine. depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when ly274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine; ly274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine. the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice, given multiple injections of methamphetamine, was also antagonized dose-dependently and completely by ly274614. the data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves nmda receptors and that ly274614 is an nmda receptor antagonist with long-lasting in vivo effects in rats.";0;0;1;0

rhabdomyolysis in a hepatitis c virus infected patient treated with telaprevir and simvastatin.;a 46-year old man with a chronic hepatitis c virus infection received triple therapy with ribavirin, pegylated interferon and telaprevir. the patient also received simvastatin. one month after starting the antiviral therapy, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he developed rhabdomyolysis. at admission simvastatin and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because toxicity due to a drug-drug interaction was suspected. the creatine kinase peaked at 62,246 iu/l and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline. the patient's renal function remained unaffected. fourteen days after hospitalization, creatine kinase level had returned to 230 iu/l and the patient was discharged. telaprevir was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with simvastatin according to the drug interaction probability scale. the interaction is due to inhibition of cyp3a4-mediated simvastatin clearance. simvastatin plasma concentration increased 30 times in this patient and statin induced muscle toxicity is related to the concentration of the statin in blood. in conclusion, with this case we illustrate that telaprevir as well as statins are susceptible to clinical relevant drug-drug interactions.;0;1;0;0

carboplatin toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat.;background: the most striking of carboplatin's advantages (cbdca) over cisplatin (cddp) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. however, the use of cbdca higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage. materials and methods: two different schedules of cbdca administration (10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg i.p. twice a week for nine times) were evaluated in wistar rats. neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral (tail-flick test), neurophysiological (nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve), morphological, morphometrical and analytical effects. results: cbdca administration induced dose-dependent peripheral neurotoxicity. pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high-dose treatment. the dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by cddp, mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons. moreover, significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after cbdca treatment. conclusions: cbdca is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by cddp that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism. this model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of cbdca on the peripheral nervous system.;0;1;1;0

aberrant splicing of phenylalanine hydroxylase mrna: the major cause for phenylketonuria in parts of southern europe.;we report a mutation within the phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) gene that causes aberrant splicing of the mrna and that is in tight association with chromosomal haplotypes 6 , 10 , and 36 . because of the high frequency of these particular haplotypes in bulgaria , italy , and turkey , it appears to be one of the more frequent defects in the pah gene causing classical phenylketonuria in this part of europe . the mutation is a g to a transition at position 546 in intron 10 of the pah gene , 11 bp upstream from the intron 10 / exon 11 boundary . it activates a cryptic splice site and results in an in-frame insertion of 9 nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mrna . normal amounts of liver pah protein are present in homozygous patients , but no catalytic activity can be detected . this loss of enzyme activity is probably caused by conformational changes resulting from the insertion of three additional amino acids ( gly-leu-gln ) between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11 . .;0;1;0;0

survey of complications of indocyanine green angiography in japan.;purpose: we evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography. methods: we sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the topcon company, which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera. results: ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between june 1984 and september 1992. before angiography, intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions. for three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing. the dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution. there were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea, exanthema, urtication, itchiness, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment. also recorded were one case of pain of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of hypotension. the two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock. conclusions: a comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to indocyanine green with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to fluorescein sodium indicated that indocyanine green is a safe as fluorescein for use in angiography.;0;0;1;0
upregulation of brain expression of p-glycoprotein in mrp2-deficient tr(-) rats resembles seizure-induced up-regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats.;purpose: the multidrug resistance protein 2 (mrp2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (bbb). mrp2 is absent in the transport-deficient (tr(-)) wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of mrp2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in mrp2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent wistar rats. by using this strategy to study the involvement of mrp2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (aeds), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for mrp2 in the bbb. however, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. this prompted us to study the brain expression of p-glycoprotein (pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the bbb, in tr(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) wistar rats. methods: the expression of mrp2 and pgp in brain and liver sections of tr(-) rats and normal wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal mrp2 antibody and the monoclonal pgp antibody c219, respectively. results: immunofluorescence staining with the mrp2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in tr(-) rats. tr(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. no such obvious upregulation of pgp was observed in liver sections. a comparable overexpression of pgp in the bbb was obtained after pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type wistar rats. experiments with systemic administration of the pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective pgp inhibitor tariquidar in tr(-) rats substantiated that pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of mrp2 in the bbb. conclusions: the data on tr(-) rats indicate that pgp plays an important role in the compensation of mrp2 deficiency in the bbb. because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that mrp2 performs a protective role in the bbb. furthermore, our data suggest that tr(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of pgp in the bbb on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.;0;1;1;0

coenzyme q10 treatment ameliorates acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mice.;the nephroprotective effect of coenzyme q10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg). coenzyme q10 treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for 6 consecutive days, starting 1 day before cisplatin administration. coenzyme q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cisplatin. coenzyme q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration. also, histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme q10 treatment. immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme q10 significantly decreased the cisplatin-induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kappab, caspase-3 and p53 in renal tissue. it was concluded that coenzyme q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice.;0;1;1;1

reverse or inverted left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome (reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy) in a young woman in the setting of amphetamine use.;"transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome was first described in japan as ""takotsubo cardiomyopathy."" this syndrome has been identified in many other countries. many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature. one of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome, with hyperdynamic apex and complete akinesia of the base (as opposed to the classic apical ballooning). in this article, we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse apical ballooning syndrome occurring after amphetamine use. this report is followed by review of the literature.";1;0;0;0
detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in anesthetized rats.;penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research. in the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized wistar rats. male wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. after a short period of basal activity recording, epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400iu/2 microl penicillin-g potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced epileptiform activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands. our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and epileptiform activity). our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental epilepsies.;1;0;1;0
resuscitation with lipid, epinephrine, or both in levobupivacaine-induced cardiac toxicity in newborn piglets.;background: the optimal dosing regimens of lipid emulsion, epinephrine, or both are not yet determined in neonates in cases of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (last). methods: newborn piglets received levobupivacaine until cardiovascular collapse occurred. standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and electrocardiogram (ecg) was monitored for ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, or qrs prolongation. piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups: control (saline), intralipid( ) alone, epinephrine alone, or a combination of intralipd plus epinephrine. resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation (rosc) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min. results: rosc was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets. mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups, but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control. the number of ecg abnormalities was zero in the intralipid only group, but 14 and 17, respectively, in the epinephrine and epinephrine plus lipid groups (p<0.05). conclusions: lipid emulsion with or without epinephrine, or epinephrine alone were equally effective in achieving a return to spontaneous circulation in this model of last. epinephrine alone or in combination with lipid was associated with an increased number of ecg abnormalities compared with lipid emulsion alone.;1;0;0;0
characterization of estrogen-induced adenohypophyseal tumors in the fischer 344 rat.;pituitary tumors were induced in f344 female rats by chronic treatment with diethylstilbestrol (des, 8-10 mg) implanted subcutaneously in silastic capsules. over a range of 1-150 days of des treatment, pairs of control and des-treated rats were sacrificed, and their pituitaries dissociated enzymatically into single-cell preparations. the cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight, intracellular prolactin (prl) content and subsequent release in primary culture, immunocytochemical prl staining, density and/or size alterations via separation on ficoll-hypaque and by unit gravity sedimentation, and cell cycle analysis, after acriflavine dna staining, by laser flow cytometry. total cell yields from des-treated pituitaries increased from 1.3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 58.9 times control values by day 150. intracellular prl content ranged from 1.9 to 9.4 times control levels, and prl release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls, after at least 8 days of des exposure. beyond 8 days of des exposure, the immunochemically prl-positive proportion of cells increased to over 50% of the total population. increased density and/or size and prl content were indicated for the majority of the prl cell population in both types of separation protocols. all these effects of des were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals. the data extend the findings of other investigators, further establishing the des-induced tumor as a model for study of prl cellular control mechanisms.;0;0;1;1
organophosphate-induced convulsions and prevention of neuropathological damages.;such organophosphorus (op) compounds as diisopropylfluorophosphate (dfp), sarin and soman are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases (aches) and butyrylcholinesterases (bches). the acute toxicity of ops is the result of their irreversible binding with aches in the central nervous system (cns), which elevates acetylcholine (ach) levels. the protective action of subcutaneously (sc) administered antidotes or their combinations in dfp (2.0 mg/kg bw) intoxication was studied in 9-10-weeks-old han-wistar male rats. the rats received ache reactivator pralidoxime-2-chloride (2pam) (30.0 mg/kg bw), anticonvulsant diazepam (2.0 mg/kg bw), a(1)-adenosine receptor agonist n(6)-cyclopentyl adenosine (cpa) (2.0 mg/kg bw), nmda-receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (+-mk801 hydrogen maleate) (2.0 mg/kg bw) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug atropine sulfate (50.0 mg/kg bw) immediately or 30 min after the single sc injection of dfp. the control rats received atropine sulfate, but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and dfp, respectively. all rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the dfp injection. the rats treated with dfp-atropine showed severe typical op-induced toxicity signs. when cpa, diazepam or 2pam was given immediately after dfp-atropine, these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning. atropine-mk801 did not offer any additional protection against dfp toxicity. in conclusion, cpa, diazepam and 2pam in combination with atropine prevented the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning and thus reduced the toxicity of dfp in rat.;0;0;1;0

design and analysis of the hypren-trial: safety of enalapril and prazosin in the initial treatment phase of patients with congestive heart failure.;since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, cases of severe hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. to assess the safety of the ace inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, randomized, prazosin-controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment. trial medication was 2.5 mg enalapril or 0.5 prazosin. subjects were 1210 inpatients with new york heart association (nyha) functional class ii and iii. patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension (5.2%) than the patients who received prazosin (12.9%). all patients recovered. it was concluded that treatment with enalapril was well tolerated and it is, therefore, unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with enalapril to inpatients.;1;0;0;0

thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy.;five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy (characterized by renal insufficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and usually thrombocytopenia) after treatment with cisplatin, bleomycin, and a vinca alkaloid. one patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, three the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders. histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation, primarily affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and glomeruli. because each patient was tumor-free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome, the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemotherapy. diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined, because renal failure may be ascribed to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug-induced bone marrow suppression.;0;1;0;1

the type of somatic mutation at apc in familial adenomatous polyposis is determined by the site of the germline mutation: a new facet to knudson's 'two-hit' hypothesis.;apc is often cited as a prime example of a tumor suppressor gene . truncating germline and somatic mutations ( or , infrequently , allelic loss ) occur in tumors in fap ( familial adenomatous polyposis ) . most sporadic colorectal cancers also have two apc mutations . clues from attenuated polyposis , missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region ( codons 1 , 250-1 , 450 ) indicate , however , that apc mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function . we have found that fap patients with germline apc mutations within a small region ( codons 1 , 194-1 , 392 at most ) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas , in contrast to other fap patients , whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region . our results indicate that different apc mutations provide cells with different selective advantages , with mutations close to codon 1 , 300 providing the greatest advantage . allelic loss is selected strongly in cells with one mutation near codon 1 , 300 . a different germline-somatic apc mutation association exists in fap desmoids . apc is not , therefore , a classical tumor suppressor . our findings also indicate a new mechanism for disease severity  if a broader spectrum of mutations is selected in tumors , the somatic mutation rate is effectively higher and more tumors grow . .;0;0;0;1

a p16ink4a-insensitive cdk4 mutant targeted by cytolytic t lymphocytes in a human melanoma.;a mutated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 ( cdk4 ) was identified as a tumor-specific antigen recognized by hla-a2 . 1-restricted autologous cytolytic t lymphocytes ( ctls ) in a human melanoma . the mutated cdk4 allele was present in autologous cultured melanoma cells and metastasis tissue , but not in the patients lymphocytes . the mutation , an arginine-to-cysteine exchange at residue 24 , was part of the cdk4 peptide recognized by ctls and prevented binding of the cdk4 inhibitor p16ink4a , but not of p21 or of p27kip1 . the same mutation was found in one additional melanoma among 28 melanomas analyzed . these results suggest that mutation of cdk4 can create a tumor-specific antigen and can disrupt the cell-cycle regulation exerted by the tumor suppressor p16ink4a . .;0;0;0;1
differential diagnosis of high serum creatine kinase levels in systemic lupus erythematosus.;we report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57-year-old woman with severe chloroquine-induced myopathy. since 1989, she had been suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) with renal involvement and undergone periods of treatment with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. additional therapy with chloroquine (cq) was started because of arthralgia. at the same time, slightly increased creatine kinase (ck) levels were noted. myositis was suspected, and the patient was treated with steroids. the ck increase persisted, however, and she developed progressive muscular weakness and muscular atrophy. routine controls revealed markedly elevated ck levels of 1,700 u/l. the neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of myositis. thus, muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude polymyositis or toxic myopathy. as it revealed chloroquine-induced myopathy, medication was stopped. discriminating between primary sle-induced affection of the musculoskeletal system and drug-induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of sle patients.;0;1;1;0

norepinephrine signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of cocaine-induced anxiety.;background: cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties. while the mechanisms underlying cocaine's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety. methods: in this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (ne), in the elevated plus maze (epm) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine-induced anxiety. results: we found that cocaine dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behavior in control (dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. the dbh -/- mice had normal baseline performance in the epm but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. cocaine-induced anxiety was also attenuated in dbh +/- mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dbh) inhibitor. in experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine-induced anxiety-like behavior in dbh +/- and wild-type c57bl6/j mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect. conclusions: these results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta-adrenergic receptors is required for cocaine-induced anxiety in mice.;0;0;1;0
genetic defect in secretion of complement c5 in mice.;a genetic deficiency of the fifth ( c5 ) component of complement1-3 , a serum glycoprotein of molecular weight ( mw ) 220 , 000 ( ref . 4 ) , has been found in 39 % of inbred strains of mice3 . sera of deficient mice lack detectable c5 activity and protein2 , 3 . in addition deficient mice produce antibody to mouse c5 when injected with sera from c5 sufficient ( normal ) strains . levy et al . 5 showed that somatic cell hybrids between c5 deficient ( b10 . d2 / old line ) macrophages and either c5 sufficient ( b10 . d2 / new line ) mouse kidney or chicken erythroblasts secreted haemolytically active mouse c5 in vitro . several possible molecular mechanisms to account for the findings were considered , but insufficient direct data were available to choose among them . we recently reported that mouse ( cd . 1 strain ) peritoneal cells in culture synthesise and secrete a single chain precursor , pro-c5 ( mw approximately 210 , 000 ) , of the two-chain ( alpha chain , 125 , 000 and beta chain 83 , 000 mw ) c5 protein6 . radiolabelled precursor c5 was contained within the cells and was secreted into the tissue culture media . using similar methods , we now find that c5 deficiency in each of five different mouse strains ( akr , swr , dba / 2j8 a / hej and b10 . d2 / old line ) is due to a failure in secretion of c5 protein and not to a failure in biosynthesis of pro-c5;0;1;1;0

flestolol: an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent.;flestolol (acc-9089) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. this agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. in long-term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta-adrenergic blockade. flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers. in contrast with other beta blockers, flestolol-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. in patients with unstable angina, flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain. it is concluded that flestolol is a potent, well-tolerated, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. use of flestolol in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation.;1;0;1;0

role of xanthine oxidase in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in rats.;"1. glucocorticoid-induced hypertension (gc-ht) in the rat is associated with nitric oxide-redox imbalance. 2. we studied the role of xanthine oxidase (xo), which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species, in dexamethasone-induced hypertension (dex-ht). 3. thirty male sprague-dawley rats were divided randomly into four treatment groups: saline, dexamethasone (dex), allopurinol plus saline, and allopurinol plus dex. 4. systolic blood pressures (sbp) and bodyweights were recorded each alternate day. thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity, and serum urate to assess xo inhibition. 5. dex increased sbp (110 +/- 2-126 +/- 3 mmhg; p < 0.001) and decreased thymus (p < 0.001) and bodyweights (p"" < 0.01). allopurinol decreased serum urate from 76 +/- 5 to 30 +/- 3 micromol/l (p < 0.001) in saline and from 84 +/- 13 to 28 +/- 2 micromol/l in dex-treated (p < 0.01) groups. 6. allopurinol did not prevent dex-ht. this, together with our previous findings that allopurinol failed to prevent adrenocorticotrophic hormone induced hypertension, suggests that xo activity is not a major determinant of gc-ht in the rat.";1;0;0;0
changes in depressive status associated with topical beta-blockers.;depression and sexual dysfunction have been related to side effects of topical beta-blockers. we performed a preliminary study in order to determine any difference between a non selective beta-blocker (timolol) and a selective beta-blocker (betaxolol) regarding cns side effects. eight glaucomatous patients chronically treated with timolol 0.5%/12h, suffering from depression diagnosed through dms-iii-r criteria, were included in the study. during the six-month follow up, depression was quantified through the beck and zung-conde scales every two months. in a double blind cross-over study with control group, the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the beck and the zung-conde scales (p < 0.001 vs control). these results suggest that betaxolol could be less of a depression-inducer than timolol in predisposed patients.;0;0;1;0

prophylactic use of lamivudine with chronic immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatologic disorders.;the objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis b virus surface antigen (hbs ag) positive patients with rheumatologic disease. from june 2004 to october 2006, 11 hbs ag positive patients with rheumatologic diseases, who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies, were retrospectively assessed. liver function tests, hepatitis b virus (hbv) serologic markers, and hbv dna levels of the patients during follow-up were obtained from hospital file records. eleven patients (six male) with median age 47 years (range 27-73), median disease duration 50 months (range 9-178) and median follow-up period of patients 13.8 months (range 5-27) were enrolled in this study. lamivudine therapy was started 3-7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. baseline, liver function tests were elevated in two patients (fourth patient: alt:122 iu/l, ast:111 iu/l, tenth patient:alt:294 iu/l, ast:274 iu/l, with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both). shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow-up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests. in four patients hbv dna levels were higher than normal at baseline. two of these normalized and the others increased later. in three additional patients, hbv dna levels were increased during follow-up. none of the patients had significant clinical sings of hbv activation. lamivudine was well tolerated and was continued in all patients. prophylactic administration of lamivudine in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe, well tolerated and effective in preventing hbv reactivation.;0;1;1;0
clinical and molecular genetic analysis of 19 wolfram syndrome kindreds demonstrating a wide spectrum of mutations in wfs1.;wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy . mtdna deletions have been described , and a gene ( wfs1 ) recently has been identified , on chromosome 4p16 , encoding a predicted 890 amino acid transmembrane protein . direct dna sequencing was done to screen the entire coding region of the wfs1 gene in 30 patients from 19 british kindreds with wolfram syndrome . dna was also screened for structural rearrangements ( deletions and duplications ) and point mutations in mtdna . no pathogenic mtdna mutations were found in our cohort . we identified 24 mutations in the wfs1 gene  8 nonsense mutations , 8 missense mutations , 3 in-frame deletions , 1 in-frame insertion , and 4 frameshift mutations . of these , 23 were novel mutations , and most occurred in exon 8 . the majority of patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations , and there was no common founder mutation . the data were also analyzed for genotype-phenotype relationships . although some interesting cases were noted , consideration of the small sample size and frequency of each mutation indicated no clear-cut correlations between any of the observed mutations and disease severity . there were no obvious mutation hot spots or clusters . hence , molecular screening for wolfram syndrome in affected families and for wolfram syndrome-carrier status in subjects with psychiatric disorders or diabetes mellitus will require complete analysis of exon 8 and upstream exons . .;0;0;1;0

suxamethonium-induced cardiac arrest and death following 5 days of immobilization.;the present report describes a case of cardiac arrest and subsequent death as a result of hyperkalaemia following the use of suxamethonium in a 23-year-old malawian woman. five days after the onset of the symptoms of meningitis, the patient aspirated stomach contents and needed endotracheal intubation. forty seconds after injection of suxamethonium, bradycardia and cardiac arrest occurred. attempts to resuscitate the patient were not successful. the serum level of potassium was observed to be 8.4 mequiv l-1. apart from the reduction in the patient's level of consciousness, there were no signs of motor neurone damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for hyperkalaemia following the administration of suxamethonium. it is postulated that her death was caused by hypersensitivity to suxamethonium, associated with her 5-day immobilization.;0;0;1;0
the epidemiology of the acute flank pain syndrome from suprofen.;"suprofen, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent. until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the united states. through august 1986, a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported. to elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 suprofen-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome. case patients were more likely to be men (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.1), suffer from hay fever and asthma (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.9); to participate in regular exercise (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7), especially in the use of nautilus equipment (p = 0.02); and to use alcohol (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.5). possible risk factors included young age, concurrent use of other analgesic agents (especially ibuprofen), preexisting renal disease, a history of kidney stones, a history of gout, a recent increase in activity, a recent increase in sun exposure, and residence in the sunbelt. these were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance. these findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome: acute diffuse crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules.";0;1;0;0

acute renal failure due to rifampicin.;a 23-year-old male patient with bacteriologically proven pulmonary tuberculosis was treated with the various regimens of antituberculosis drugs for nearly 15 months. rifampicin was administered thrice as one of the 3-4 drug regimen and each time he developed untoward side effects like nausea, vomiting and fever with chills and rigors. the last such episode was of acute renal failure at which stage the patient was seen by the authors of this report. the patient, however, made a full recovery.;0;1;0;0
on the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine in rats.;the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rats. saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic (a group). the other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped (s) licking and/or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic (k) behaviour (as/ks group), suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation. the rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days' treatment. in a further series of experiments, haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference. haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the a group. however, the level in the as/ks group remained considerably lower than in the a group. the results suggest that rigidity, which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum. nevertheless, there occurs some real tolerance to this effect. the rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the as/ks group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various da-innervated structures.;0;0;1;0

serotonin reuptake inhibitors, paranoia, and the ventral basal ganglia.;antidepressants have previously been associated with paranoid reactions in psychiatric patients. five cases of paranoid exacerbation with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and amitriptyline are reported here. elements common to these cases included a history of paranoid symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptoms. complicated depressive disorders (including atypicality of course and symptomatology, chronicity, psychosis, bipolarity, and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. although the pharmacology and neurobiology of paranoia remain cryptic, several mechanisms, including 5ht3 receptor-mediated dopamine release, beta-noradrenergic receptor downregulation, or gabab receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia (possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits), might apply to this phenomenon. these cases call attention to possible paranoid exacerbations with serotonin reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding paranoia.;0;0;1;0

a dystonia-like syndrome after neuropeptide (msh/acth) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus.;"the movement disorder investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic dystonia, and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit. the present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the lc resulted in a ne-mediated inhibition of cerebellar purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway. however, it is not certain as to the following: (a) what receptors were stimulated by the acth n-terminal fragments at the lc that resulted in this disorder; (b) whether ne, released onto purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway, did indeed cause the long-term depression at purkinje cell synapses (previously described by others) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder; (c) whether the inhibition of inhibitory purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei, the output targets of the purkinje cell axons, that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder. these questions are currently being investigated.";0;0;1;0
bupropion (zyban) toxicity.;bupropion is a monocyclic antidepressant structurally related to amphetamine. zyban, a sustained-release formulation of bupropion hydrochloride, was recently released in ireland, as a smoking cessation aid. in the initial 6 months since it's introduction, 12 overdose cases have been reported to the national poisons information centre. 8 patients developed symptoms of toxicity. common features included tachycardia, drowsiness, hallucinations and convulsions. two patients developed severe cardiac arrhythmias, including one patient who was resuscitated following a cardiac arrest. all patients recovered without sequelae. we report a case of a 31 year old female who required admission to the intensive care unit for ventilation and full supportive therapy, following ingestion of 13.5g bupropion. recurrent seizures were treated with diazepam and broad complex tachycardia was successfully treated with adenosine. zyban caused significant neurological and cardiovascular toxicity in overdose. the potential toxic effects should be considered when prescribing it as a smoking cessation aid.;1;0;1;0

worsening of levodopa-induced dyskinesias by motor and mental tasks.;"ten patients who had parkinson's disease with disabling dyskinesia were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental (mental calculation) and motor (flexion/extension of right fingers, flexion/extension of left fingers, flexion/extension of the neck, speaking aloud) tasks on the worsening of peak-dose dyskinesia following administration of an effective single dose of apomorphine. compared with the score at rest (1.3+/-0.3), a significant aggravation of the dyskinesia score was observed during speaking aloud (5.2+/-1.1, p<0.05), movements of right (4.5+/-1.0, p<0.05) and left (3.7+/-0.8, p<0.05) fingers, movements of the neck (5.1+/-1.0, p<0.05), and mental calculation (3.1+/-1.0, p<0.05). these results suggest that activation tasks such as ""speaking aloud"" could be used for objective assessment of dyskinesia severity.";0;0;1;0
damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the rat: immunohistochemical study of neurons, astrocytes and serum-protein extravasation.;the substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity. additionally, in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra (snr) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated snr. in this study, status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats. the neuropathology of snr was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time-course of changes in neurons and astrocytes. animals surviving 20, 30, 40, 60 min, 2, 3, 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion-fixed, and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of snr. nissl-staining and antibodies against the neuron-specific calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, served to detect neuronal damage in snr. antibodies against the astroglia-specific cytoskeletal protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), and against the glial calcium-binding protein, s-100 protein, were used to assess the status of astrocytes. immunohistochemical staining for serum-albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood-brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation. immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of gfap-staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of snr while sparing medial and lateral aspects. at 1 h there was additional vacuolation in s-100 protein staining. by 2 hours, parvalbumin-staining changed in the central snr indicating neuronal damage, and nissl-staining visualized some neuronal distortion. staining for serum-proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours. by 6 h, vasogenic edema covered the lesioned snr. by 24 h, glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of snr. by 48-72 h, astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size, and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area. in a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days, conventional paraffin-sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of snr. additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus. since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in snr it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in snr. both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus.;0;0;1;0

mutations associated with variant phenotypes in ataxia-telangiectasia.;we have identified 14 families with ataxia-telangiectasia ( a-t ) in which mutation of the atm gene is associated with a less severe clinical and cellular phenotype ( approximately 10 % -15 % of a-t families identified in the united kingdom ) . in 10 of these families , all the homozygotes have a 137-bp insertion in their cdna caused by a point mutation in a sequence resembling a splice-donor site . the second a-t allele has a different mutation in each patient . we show that the less severe phenotype in these patients is caused by some degree of normal splicing , which occurs as an alternative product from the insertion-containing allele . the level of the 137-bp pcr product containing the insertion was lowest in two patients who showed a later onset of cerebellar ataxia . a further four families who do not have this insertion have been identified . mutations detected in two of four of these are missense mutations , normally rare in a-t patients . the demonstration of mutations giving rise to a slightly milder phenotype in a-t raises the interesting question of what range of phenotypes might occur in individuals in whom both mutations are milder . one possibility might be that individuals who are compound heterozygotes for atm mutations are more common than we realize . .;0;0;1;0

effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus.;the effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving tacrolimus was evaluated between january 1992 and january 1996. two groups of patients receiving tacrolimus were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising hypertensive patients who were receiving nifedipine, and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving nifedipine. the time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients. nifedipine significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum creatinine levels at 6 and 12 months. the observed positive impact of nifedipine on reducing the nephrotoxicity associated with tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat hypertension in this population.;1;1;0;0

function of an axonal chemoattractant modulated by metalloprotease activity.;the axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons by activating its receptor dcc ( deleted in colorectal cancer ) . we have found that chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon outgrowth in vitro . we have also found that dcc is a substrate for metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding , and that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of dcc and cause an increase in dcc protein levels on axons within spinal cord explants . thus , potentiation of netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of dcc on the axons , and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance receptors . .;0;0;0;1

prenatal dexamethasone programs hypertension and renal injury in the rat.;"dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development. the purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase in blood pressure and renal injury in rats. pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg body weight) on gestational days 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 17 and 18, or 19 and 20. offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (22 527+/-509 versus 28 050+/-561, p<0.05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age. six- to 9-month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17% reduction in glomeruli (23 380+/-587) compared with control rats (p<0.05). male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular number. adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats. this study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number, glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation. hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number, suggesting that a reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension.";1;1;1;0

relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of coronary stenosis: correlation with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography.;"it has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation. the aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis. the perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual-perfusion technique and with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography (spect). during a transient (20-s) coronary occlusion, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced. the perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.74; p less than 0.002). during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. the four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia. the size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.61; p = 0.02). thallium-201 spect demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03). thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis. the results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium-201 spect.";1;0;0;0

investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine.;mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis, such as energy generation, control of cell death, neurotransmitter synthesis, and free radical (fr) production. increased production of frs may cause mtdna damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtdna-encoded subunits. in this study, we investigated whether increased generation of fr during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtdna and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (cco), complex iv of the respiratory chain, in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. dna analysis revealed low amounts of a 4.8 kb mtdna deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups. we did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtdna-encoded subunit of cco (cco-i) or a relative decrease in cco-i when compared with nuclear-encoded subunits (cco-iv and sdh-fp). no abnormality in cco activity was observed through histochemistry. although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies, our results do not suggest that the frs, generated during the acute phase, determined important abnormalities in mtdna, in expression of cco-i, and in cco activity.;0;0;1;0
alpha and beta coma in drug intoxication uncomplicated by cerebral hypoxia.;four patients who were rendered comatose or stuporous by drug intoxication, but who were not hypoxic, are described. three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam. the patient with nitrazepam overdose and two of those with chlormethiazole intoxication conformed to the criteria of 'alpha coma', showing non-reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the eeg. the fourth patient who was unconscious after chlormethiazole administration exhibite generalized non-reactive activity in the slow beta range. all four recovered completely without neurological sequelae following the withdrawal of the offending agents. the similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological depression of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed. it is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo-thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha coma. it is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication, in the absence of significant hypoxaemia, a favourable outcome may be anticipated.;0;0;1;0

involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity in the rat.;whereas muscular rigidity is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). we investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon, using male sprague-dawley rats anesthetized with ketamine. under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal co2, intravenous administration of fentanyl (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles. such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. microinjection of fentanyl (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation. it is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.;0;0;1;0
nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycoside treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation.;to quantify the effects of gentamicin, kanamycin and netilmicin on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation, these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg/day) for 7, 14 or 21 days. scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endothelia, urinary measurements of sodium, potassium, endogenous lysozyme, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nag) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance (gfr) were done in each treatment group. gentamicin administration decreased diameter, density and shape of endothelial fenestrae. kanamycin and netilmicin appeared to have no effect at the dose used. all three aminoglycosides decreased gfr and increased urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. while gentamicin and kanamycin decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme netilmicin had no effect. daily excretion of total protein, endogenous lysozyme and nag increased only after treatment with kanamycin and gentamicin. thus, aminoglycosides may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and/or tubular level inducing impairment of renal reabsorption and accumulation of proteins.;0;1;0;0

low levels of beta hexosaminidase a in healthy individuals with apparent deficiency of this enzyme.;appreciable beta hexosaminidase a ( hex a ) activity has been detected in cultured skin fibroblasts and melanoma tissue from healthy individuals previously reported as having deficiency of hex a activity indistinguishable from that of patients with tay-sachs disease ( tsd ) . identification and quantitation of hex a , amounting to 3 . 5 % -6 . 9 % of total beta hexosaminidase activity , has been obtained by cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis , deae-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography , radial immunodiffusion , and radioimmunoassay . previous family studies suggested that these individuals may be compound heterozygotes for the common mutant tsd gene and a rare ( allelic ) mutant gene . thus , the postulated rate mutant gene appears to code for the expression of low amounts of hex a . heterozygotes for the rare mutant may be indistinguishable from heterozygotes for the common tsd mutant . however , direct visualization and quantitation of hex a by the methods described may prevent false-positive prenatal diagnosis of tsd in fetuses having the incomplete hex a deficiency of the type described in the four healthy individuals;0;0;0;1

diagnosis of hemochromatosis.;if untreated , hemochromatosis can cause serious illness and early death , but the disease is still substantially under-diagnosed . the cornerstone of screening and case detection is the measurement of serum transferrin saturation and the serum ferritin level . once the diagnosis is suspected , physicians must use serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron stores on liver biopsy specimens to assess patients for the presence of iron overload . liver biopsy is also used to establish the presence or absence of cirrhosis , which can affect prognosis and management . a dna-based test for the hfe gene is commercially available , but its place in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is still being evaluated . currently , the most useful role for this test is in the detection of hemochromatosis in the family members of patients with a proven case of the disease . it is crucial to diagnose hemochromatosis before hepatic cirrhosis develops because phlebotomy therapy can avert serious chronic disease and can even lead to normal life expectancy . .;0;1;0;0
liver-specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in mice results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administration.;we have recently demonstrated that disruption of extracellular matrix (ecm)/integrin signaling via elimination of integrin-linked kinase (ilk) in hepatocytes interferes with signals leading to termination of liver regeneration. this study investigates the role of ilk in liver enlargement induced by phenobarbital (pb). wild-type (wt) and ilk:liver-/- mice were given pb (0.1% in drinking water) for 10 days. livers were harvested on 2, 5, and 10 days during pb administration. in the hepatocyte-specific ilk/liver-/- mice, the liver:body weight ratio was more than double as compared to 0 h at day 2 (2.5 times), while at days 5 and 10, it was enlarged three times. in the wt mice, the increase was as expected from previous literature (1.8 times) and seems to have leveled off after day 2. there were slightly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in the ilk/liver-/- animals at day 2 as compared to wt after pb administration. in the wt animals, the proliferative response had come back to normal by days 5 and 10. hepatocytes of the ilk/liver-/- mice continued to proliferate up until day 10. ilk/liver-/- mice also showed increased expression of key genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation at different time points during pb administration. in summary, ecm proteins communicate with the signaling machinery of dividing cells via ilk to regulate hepatocyte proliferation and termination of the proliferative response. lack of ilk in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as pb.;0;1;1;0

lamivudine is effective in suppressing hepatitis b virus dna in chinese hepatitis b surface antigen carriers: a placebo-controlled trial.;lamivudine is a novel 2',3'-dideoxy cytosine analogue that has potent inhibitory effects on hepatitis b virus replication in vitro and in vivo. we performed a single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess its effectiveness and safety in chinese hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) carriers. forty-two chinese hbsag carriers were randomized to receive placebo (6 patients) or lamivudine orally in dosages of 25 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg daily (12 patients for each dosage). the drug was given for 4 weeks. the patients were closely monitored clinically, biochemically, and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment. all 36 patients receiving lamivudine had a decrease in hepatitis b virus (hbv) dna values of >90% (p < .001 compared with placebo). although 25 mg of lamivudine was slightly less effective than 100 mg (p = .011) and 300 mg (p = .005), it still induced 94% suppression of hbv dna after the fourth week of therapy. hbv dna values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy. there was no change in the hepatitis b e antigen status or in aminotransferase levels. no serious adverse events were observed. in conclusion, a 4-week course of lamivudine was safe and effective in suppression of hbv dna in chinese hbsag carriers. the suppression was >90% but reversible. studies with long-term lamivudine administration should be performed to determine if prolonged suppression of hbv dna can be achieved.;0;1;0;0

paclitaxel 3-hour infusion given alone and combined with carboplatin: preliminary results of dose-escalation trials.;"paclitaxel (taxol; bristol-myers squibb company, princeton, nj) by 3-hour infusion was combined with carboplatin in a phase i/ii study directed to patients with non-small cell lung cancer. carboplatin was given at a fixed target area under the concentration-time curve of 6.0 by the calvert formula, whereas paclitaxel was escalated in patient cohorts from 150 mg/m2 (dose level i) to 175, 200, 225, and 250 mg/m2. the 225 mg/m2 level was expanded for the phase ii study since the highest level achieved (250 mg/m2) required modification because of nonhematologic toxicities (arthralgia and sensory neuropathy). therapeutic effects were noted at all dose levels, with objective responses in 17 (two complete and 15 partial regressions) of 41 previously untreated patients. toxicities were compared with a cohort of patients in a phase i trial of paclitaxel alone at identical dose levels. carboplatin did not appear to add to the hematologic toxicities observed, and the paclitaxel/carboplatin combination could be dosed every 3 weeks.";0;0;1;1
the activation of spinal n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of spinal cord ischemia.;"we investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats. spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter. in a microdialysis study, 10 mul of saline (group c; n = 8) or 30 mug of morphine (group m; n = 8) was injected intrathecally (it) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of morphine (group sm; n = 8) or 10 mul of saline (group sc; n = 8) was injected it 0.5 h after sham operation. microdialysis samples were collected preischemia, before it injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after it injection). second, we investigated the effect of it mk-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis. after it morphine, the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) glutamate concentration was increased in group m relative to both baseline and group c (p < 0.05). this increase persisted for 8 hrs. it mk-801 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group. these data indicate that it morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in csf glutamate, which is involved in nmda receptor activation. we suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via nmda receptor activation.";1;0;1;0

spectrum of adverse events after generic haart in southern indian hiv-infected patients.;"to determine the incidence of clinically significant adverse events after long-term, fixed-dose, generic highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) use among hiv-infected individuals in south india, we examined the experiences of 3154 hiv-infected individuals who received a minimum of 3 months of generic haart between february 1996 and december 2006 at a tertiary hiv care referral center in south india. the most common regimens were 3tc + d4t + nevirapine (nvp) (54.8%), zidovudine (azt) + 3tc + nvp (14.5%), 3tc + d4t + efavirenz (efv) (20.1%), and azt + 3tc + efv (5.4%). the most common adverse events and median cd4 at time of event were rash (15.2%; cd4, 285 cells/microl) and peripheral neuropathy (9.0% and 348 cells/microl). clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dl) was observed in 5.4% of patients (cd4, 165 cells/microl) and hepatitis (clinical jaundice with alanine aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal) in 3.5% of patients (cd4, 260 cells/microl). women were significantly more likely to experience lactic acidosis, while men were significantly more likely to experience immune reconstitution syndrome (p < 0.05). among the patients with 1 year of follow-up, nvp therapy was significantly associated with developing rash and d4t therapy with developing peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05). anemia and hepatitis often occur within 12 weeks of initiating generic haart. frequent and early monitoring for these toxicities is warranted in developing countries where generic haart is increasingly available.";0;1;1;0

hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism under deliberate hypotension. an experimental study in dogs.;coronary blood flow, cardiac work and metabolism were studied in dogs under sodium nitroprusside (snp) and trimetaphan (tmp) deliberate hypotension (20% and 40% mean pressure decrease from baseline). regarding the effects of drug-induced hypotension on coronary blood flow, aortic and coronary sinus metabolic data (ph, po2, pco2) we could confirm that nitroprusside hypotension could be safely used to 30% mean blood pressure decrease from control, trimetaphan hypotension to 20% mean blood pressure decrease. cardiac work was significantly reduced during snp hypotension. myocardial o2 consumption and o2 availability were directly dependent on the coronary perfusion. careful invasive monitoring of the blood pressure, blood gases and of the ecg st-t segment is mandatory.;1;0;0;0

memory function and serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism in ecstasy (mdma) users.;"although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (mdma or ecstasy) has been shown to damage brain serotonin (5-ht) neurons in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences of mdma-induced 5-ht neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5-ht is involved, such as cognitive function. because 5-ht transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5-ht transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5-ht transporter promoter gene region (5-httlpr) when studying the effects of mdma as well as cognitive functioning. the aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy mdma use on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term abstention from mdma, in subjects genotyped for 5-httlpr. a second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males. fifteen moderate mdma users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy mdma+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 ex-mdma+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests. dna from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-httlpr using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.a significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks (p = 0.04) but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/executive functioning (p = 0.59). heavy and ex-mdma+ users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls. in contrast, no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate mdma users. no significant effect of 5-httlpr or gender was observed. while the use of mdma in quantities that may be considered ""moderate"" is not associated with impaired memory functioning, heavy use of mdma use may lead to long lasting memory impairments. no effect of 5-httlpr or gender on memory function or mdma use was observed.";0;0;1;0
glial activation and post-synaptic neurotoxicity: the key events in streptozotocin (icv) induced memory impairment in rats.;"in the present study the role of glial activation and post synaptic toxicity in icv streptozotocin (stz) induced memory impaired rats was explored. in experiment set up 1: memory deficit was found in morris water maze test on 14-16 days after stz (icv; 3mg/kg) administration. stz causes increased expression of gfap, cd11b and tnf-a indicating glial activation and neuroinflammation. stz also significantly increased the level of ros, nitrite, ca(2+) and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitotoxicity. increased expression and activity of caspase-3 was also observed in stz treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex. stz treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers camkiia and psd-95, while, expression of pre synaptic markers (synaptophysin and snap-25) remains unaltered indicating selective post synaptic neurotoxicity. oral treatment with memantine (10mg/kg) and ibuprofen (50 mg/kg) daily for 13 days attenuated stz induced glial activation, apoptotic cell death and post synaptic neurotoxicity in rat brain. further, in experiment set up 2: where memory function was not affected i.e. 7-9 days after stz treatment. the level of gfap, cd11b, tnf-a, ros and nitrite levels were increased. on the other hand, apoptotic marker, synaptic markers, mitochondrial activity and ca(2+) levels remained unaffected. collective data indicates that neuroinflammatory process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function. present study clearly suggests that glial activation and post synaptic neurotoxicity are the key factors in stz induced memory impairment and neuronal cell death.";0;0;1;0

respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy.;purpose: apnea is known to occur during seizures, but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few. data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce. here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. methods: twelve rats (six chronically epileptic animals and six controls) were anesthetized, given tracheotomies, and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions. breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph. this flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer, passed through a polygraph, and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation (ve), tidal volume (vt), inspiratory time (ti), expiratory time (te), breathing frequency (f), and mean inspiratory flow (vt/ti) on a breath-by-breath basis. results: the hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine-treated and control rats. although ve had a similar decrease in both groups, in the epileptic group, the decrease in ve was due to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in te peak in relation to that of the control animals. the hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial paco2, followed by an increase in ve. in the epileptic group, the increase in ve was mediated by a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in te peak compared with the control group. systemic application of kcn, to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation, led to a similar increase in ve for both groups. conclusions: the data indicate that pilocarpine-treated animals have an altered ability to react to (or compensate for) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined. we speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy-associated conditions.;0;0;1;0

probing peripheral and central cholinergic system responses.;"objective: the pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as alzheimer's disease, yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied. this study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the tropicamide-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with pilocarpine. scopolamine was used as a positive control to detect age-dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly. design: randomized double-blind controlled trial. participants: ten healthy elderly (mean age 70) and 9 young (mean age 33) volunteers. interventions: pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours. the study involved 4 sessions. in 1 session, tropicamide (20 microl, 0.01%) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other. in another session, tropicamide (20 microl, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of pilocarpine (20 microl, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other. all eye drops were given in a randomized order. in 2 separate sessions, a single dose of scopolamine (0.5 mg, intravenously) or placebo was administered, and the effects on word recall were measured using the buschke selective reminding test over 2 hours. outcome measures: pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine; scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall. results: there was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to tropicamide at any time point (p > 0.05). the elderly group had a significantly greater pilocarpine-induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group (p < 0.05). compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05). conclusion: there is an age-related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with tropicamide. thus, pilocarpine may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients.";0;0;1;0

evidence for an involvement of d1 and d2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced hyperactivity in rats.;previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation. in the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined. in addition, the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective d1 and d2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine. locomotor activity was assessed in male sprague-dawley rats tested in photocell cages. nicotine (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment. the stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors. nicotine-induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective d1 antagonist sch 23390, the selective d2 antagonist raclopride and the d1/d2 antagonist fluphenazine. pretreatment with the d2 agonist phno enhanced nicotine-induced hyperactivity, whereas the d1 agonist skf 38393 had no effect. the results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment. the effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors, possibly located on dopaminergic neurons, and also requires the activation of both d1 and d2 dopamine receptors.;0;0;1;0

consensus statement concerning cardiotoxicity occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with special reference to systemic sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.;autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune diseases. worldwide, over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase i and ii clinical trials. the results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase iii trials. however, as predicted, significant transplant-related morbidity and mortality have been observed. this is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections. the number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low. however, caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage, for example, systemic sclerosis patients. in november 2002, a meeting was held in florence, bringing together a number of experts in various fields, including rheumatology, cardiology, neurology, pharmacology and transplantation medicine. the object of the meeting was to analyse existing data, both published or available, in the european group for blood and marrow transplantation autoimmune disease database, and to propose a safe approach to such patients. a full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation.;1;0;1;0
relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and hippocampal nicotinic receptors.;a controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha-bungarotoxin binding. using mice derived from a classical f2 and backcross genetic design, a relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and alpha-bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found. mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine had greater alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than seizure insensitive mice. the binding sites from seizure sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with dithiothreitol, trypsin or heat. thus it appears that the difference between seizure sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha-bungarotoxin binding.;0;0;1;0

persistent paralysis after prolonged use of atracurium in the absence of corticosteroids.;neuromuscular blocking agents (nmbas) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. reports of persistent paralysis after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid-based nmbas such as vecuronium bromide, especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids. atracurium besylate, a short-acting benzylisoquinolinium nmba that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function, has also been associated with persistent paralysis, but only when used with corticosteroids. we report a case of atracurium-related paralysis persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids.;0;1;1;0

maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 in a boy with a normal karyotype.;we report on a boy with a maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 ( upd ( 14 ) ) . at 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of prader-willi syndrome ( pws ) . he showed short stature , obesity , mild developmental delay , cryptorchidism , and some mild dysmorphic features . the history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy . his mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth . after birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking , for which gavage feeding was needed . motor development was delayed . after 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite . recurrent middle ear infections , a high pain threshold , and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported . there were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance . chromosomal analysis was normal ( 46 , xy ) . dna analysis for prader-willi syndrome showed no abnormalities . two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the pws-like phenotype associated with maternal upd ( 14 ) . at that time precocious puberty was evident . dna analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14 . in all the previously described 11 cases with maternal upd ( 14 ) , a robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before dna analysis . this is the first report of diagnosis of maternal upd ( 14 ) based on clinical features . this finding underlines the importance of dna analysis for maternal upd ( 14 ) in patients with a similar pws-like phenotype even without previous identification of a robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 . .;0;0;1;0
permeability, ultrastructural changes, and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis.;background/aims: it is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria starts. using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (pan) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes. methods: using immune stainings, semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope. permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers. possible effects of ace inhibition were tested. results: by day 2, some patchy foot process effacement, but no proteinuria, appeared. the amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas. the other proteins showed few changes, which were limited to diseased areas. by day 4, foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage. nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a-actinin remained unchanged. ace inhibition had no significant protective effect. conclusions: pan glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4, despite relatively mild proteinuria. this was preceded by altered nephrin expression, supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology. the novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting roles in pan, whereas a-actinin was unchanged.;0;1;1;0

estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the hiv protease inhibitor ritonavir.;individuals with hiv can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir. many patients, however, develop negative long-term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis. we have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice. furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation. in the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the hiv protease inhibitor ritonavir. we have utilized the human monocyte cell line, thp-1 as a model to address this question. briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nm pma to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nm 17beta-estradiol (e2), 100 nm progesterone or vehicle (0.01% ethanol). cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated ldl for 24 h. cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total rna was isolated. e2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment. ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, cd36 mrna, responsible for the uptake of ldl. additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of ppargamma mrna, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of cd36 mrna expression. treatment with e2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mrna level. e2 did, however, significantly suppress cd36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. this data suggests that e2 modifies the expression of cd36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment.;0;0;1;0

differential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats.;the muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine induces in rats seizures and status epilepticus followed by widespread damage to the forebrain. the present study was designed to investigate the effect of 5 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sodium salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, ibuprofen and mefenamic acid, on seizures produced by pilocarpine. pretreatment of rats with sodium salicylate, ed50 103 mg/kg (60-174), and phenylbutazone, 59 mg/kg (50-70) converted the non-convulsant dose of pilocarpine, 200 mg/kg, to a convulsant one. indomethacin, 1-10 mg/kg, and ibuprofen, 10-100 mg/kg, failed to modulate seizures produced by pilocarpine. mefenamic acid, 26 (22-30) mg/kg, prevented seizures and protected rats from seizure-related brain damage induced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. these results indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs differentially modulate the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures.;0;0;1;0
clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus (fk506) for at least one year.;"background: we clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus (fk506) for more than 1 year. methods: twenty-six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated. thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy). results: the main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (ar; n = 4), chronic rejection (cr; n=5), ar+cr (n =4), recurrent iga nephropathy (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic fk506 nephropathy (n = 9), and mild-type fk506 nephropathy (n = 11). of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic fk506 nephropathy, respectively. chronic fk506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis (11 biopsies). the serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild-type chronic fk506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic fk506-nephropathy group (p< 0.001). conclusions: this study demonstrates that chronic fk506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic fk506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.";0;1;0;0
patterns of hepatic injury induced by methyldopa.;twelve patients with liver disease related to methyldopa were seen between 1967 and 1977. illness occurred within 1--9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients, the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months, 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms. jaundice with tender hepatomegaly, usually preceded by symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and associated with upper abdominal pain, was an invariable finding in all patients. biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular necrosis and correlated with histopathological evidence of hepatic injury, the spectrum of which ranged from fatty change and focal hepatocellular necrosis to massive hepatic necrosis. most patients showed moderate to severe acute hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis with associated cholestasis. the drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients, with rapid clinical improvement in 9. one patient died, having presented in hepatic failure, and another, who had been taking methyldopa for 7 years, showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months. the remaining patient in the series developed fulminant hepatitis when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of methyldopa-induced hepatitis. in this latter patient, and in 2 others, the causal relationship between methyldopa and hepatic dysfunction was proved with the recurrence of hepatitis within 2 weeks of re-exposure to the drug.;0;1;1;0

neuroprotective effects of melatonin upon the offspring cerebellar cortex in the rat model of bcnu-induced cortical dysplasia.;cortical dysplasia is a malformation characterized by defects in proliferation, migration and maturation. this study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum induced by maternal exposure to carmustine-[1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoure] (bcnu) and to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin upon cerebellar bcnu-induced cortical dysplasia, using histological and biochemical analyses. pregnant wistar rats were assigned to five groups: intact-control, saline-control, melatonin-treated, bcnu-exposed and bcnu-exposed plus melatonin. rats were exposed to bcnu on embryonic day 15 and melatonin was given until delivery. immuno/histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum, and levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were determined. histopathologically, typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups, but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in bcnu-exposed cortical dysplasia group. there was a marked increase in the number of tunel positive cells and nestin positive cells in bcnu-exposed group, but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed, indicating a delayed maturation, and melatonin significantly reversed these changes. malondialdehyde level in bcnu-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in bcnu group (p<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups. these data suggest that exposure of animals to bcnu during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and melatonin protects the cerebellum against the effects of bcnu.;0;1;1;0

bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation for parkinson's disease.;"high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (stn) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced parkinson's disease. aim: we studied the effect of high frequency stn stimulation in 23 patients. method: twenty-three patients suffering from severe parkinson's disease (stages iii-v on hoehn and yahr scale) and, particularly bradykinesia, rigidity, and levodopa-induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the stn. preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up, in ""on"" and ""off"" drug conditions, was carried out using unified parkinson's disease rating scale, hoehn and yahr staging, england activities of daily living score and video recordings. results: after one year of electrical stimulation of the stn, the patients' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores (unified parkinson's disease rating scale parts ii and iii) off medication improved by 62% and 61% respectively (p<0.0005). the subscores for the akinesia, rigidity, tremor and gait also improved. (p<0.0005). the average levodopa dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg. the cognitive functions remained unchanged. two patients developed device-related complications and two patients experienced abnormal weight gain. conclusion: bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation is an effective treatment for advanced parkinson's disease. it reduces the severity of ""off"" phase symptoms, improves the axial symptoms and reduces levodopa requirements. the reduction in the levodopa dose is useful in controlling drug-induced dyskinesias.";0;0;1;0

reversal by phenylephrine of the beneficial effects of intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction.;nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce st-segment elevation during acute myocardial infarction, an effect potentiated in the dog by agents that reverse nitroglycerin-induced hypotension. our study was designed to determine the effects of combined nitroglycerin and phenylephrine therapy. ten patients with acute transmural myocardial infarctions received intravenous nitroglycerin, sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure from 107 +/- 6 to 85 +/- 6 mm hg (p less than 0.001), for 60 minutes. left ventricular filling pressure decreased from 19 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 2 mm hg (p less than 0.001). sigmast, the sum of st-segment elevations in 16 precordial leads, decreased (p less than 0.02) with intravenous nitroglycerin. subsequent addition of phenylephrine infusion, sufficient to re-elevate mean arterial pressure to 106 +/- 4 mm hg (p less than 0.001) for 30 minutes, increased left ventricular filling pressure to 17 +/- 2 mm hg (p less than 0.05) and also significantly increased sigmast (p less than 0.05). our results suggest that addition of phenylephrine to nitroglycerin is not beneficial in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction.;1;0;0;0

swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia triggered by salbutamol: case report and review of the literature.;"case: a 49-year-old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing. on electrocardiogram, episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing; 24-hour holter monitoring recorded several events. the arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol, but recurred a year later. the patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol. after stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the atenolol, the arrhythmia disappeared. discussion: swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia (siat) is a rare phenomenon. fewer than 50 cases of siat have been described in the literature. this article summarizes all the cases published, creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to siat. it discusses demographics, clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia, postulated mechanisms of siat, and different treatment possibilities such as medications, surgery, and radiofrequency catheter ablation (rfca). conclusion: salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for siat. although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like salbutamol (known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as atenolol (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.";1;0;1;0
regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and apoptotic pathways by betaine attenuates isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial injury in rats.;the present study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of betaine on acute myocardial ischemia induced experimentally in rats focusing on regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) and apoptotic pathways as the potential mechanism underlying the drug effect. male sprague dawley rats were treated with betaine (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) orally for 40 days. acute myocardial ischemic injury was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg), for two consecutive days. serum cardiac marker enzyme, histopathological variables and expression of protein levels were analyzed. oral administration of betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly reduced the level of cardiac marker enzyme in the serum and prevented left ventricular remodeling. western blot analysis showed that isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of stat3 was maintained or further enhanced by betaine treatment in myocardium. furthermore, betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) treatment increased the ventricular expression of bcl-2 and reduced the level of bax, therefore causing a significant increase in the ratio of bcl-2/bax. the protective role of betaine on myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. in summary, our results showed that betaine pretreatment attenuated isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia via the regulation of stat3 and apoptotic pathways.;1;0;0;0

neuropsychiatric behaviors in the mptp marmoset model of parkinson's disease.;objectives: neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with parkinson's disease (pd). these symptoms may be due to 'sensitisation' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state. the levodopa-treated mptp-lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd patients. here we compare the time course of levodopa-induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms. methods: marmosets were administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2.0 mg/kg s.c.) for five days, resulting in stable parkinsonism. levodopa (15 mg/kg and benserazide, 3.75 mg/kg) p.o. b.i.d, was administered for 30 days. animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability, dyskinesia and on-time (motor fluctuations) and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors on day 0 (prior to levodopa) and on days 1, 7, 13, 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc dvd analysis by a trained rater, blind to the treatment day. results: the neuropsychiatric-like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds. as anticipated, animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa-induced motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and wearing-off, that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy. in contrast, levodopa-induced neuropsychiatric-like behaviors were present on day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment. conclusions: the data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in pd are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy.;0;0;1;0
fusion genes resulting from alternative chromosomal translocations are overexpressed by gene-specific mechanisms in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.;"chromosomal translocations identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in deregulated expression of protooncogenes or creation of chimeric proteins with tumorigenic potential . in the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , a consistent t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) or variant t ( 1 ; 13 ) ( p36 ; q14 ) translocation generates pax3-fkhr or pax7-fkhr fusion proteins , respectively . in this report , we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression . furthermore , pax3-fkhr and pax7-fkhr overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms . transcription of pax3-fkhr is increased relative to wild-type pax3 by a copy number-independent process . in contrast , pax7-fkhr overexpression results from fusion gene amplification . thus , gene-specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress pax3-fkhr and pax7-fkhr in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , presumably due to differences in regulation between the wild-type loci . we postulate that these overexpression mechanisms ensure a critical level of gene product for the oncogenic effects of these fusions . .";0;0;1;1
uncoupling of hypomyelination and glial cell death by a mutation in the proteolipid protein gene.;"proteolipid protein ( plp ; m ( r ) 30 , 000 ) is a highly conserved major polytopic membrane protein in myelin but its cellular function remains obscure . neurological mutant mice can often provide model systems for human genetic disorders . mutations of the x-chromosome-linked plp gene are lethal , identified first in the jimpy mouse and subsequently in patients with pelizaeus-merzbacher disease . the unexplained phenotype of these mutations includes degeneration and premature cell death of oligodendrocytes with associated hypomyelination . here we show that a new mouse mutant rumpshaker is defined by the amino-acid substitution ile-to-thr at residue 186 in a membrane-embedded domain of plp . surprisingly , rumpshaker mice , although myelin-deficient , have normal longevity and a full complement of morphologically normal oligodendrocytes . hypomyelination can thus be genetically separated from the plp-dependent oligodendrocyte degeneration . we suggest that plp has a vital function in glial cell development , distinct from its later role in myelin assembly , and that this dichotomy of action may explain the clinical spectrum of pelizaeus-merzbacher disease . .";0;0;1;0

risk factors and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic malaysians with parkinson's disease.;chronic pulsatile levodopa therapy for parkinson's disease (pd) leads to the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. we studied the prevalence and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic malaysian patients with pd. methods: this is a cross-sectional study involving 95 patients with pd on uninterrupted levodopa therapy for at least 6 months. the instrument used was the updrs questionnaires. the predictors of dyskinesia were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. results: the mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years. the mean onset age was 58.5 + 9.8 years. the median disease duration was 6 (7) years. dyskinesia was present in 44% (n = 42) with median levodopa therapy of 3 years. there were 64.3% chinese, 31% malays, and 3.7% indians and other ethnic groups. eighty-one percent of patients with dyskinesia had clinical fluctuations. patients with dyskinesia had lower onset age ( p < 0.001), longer duration of levodopa therapy ( p < 0.001), longer disease duration ( p < 0.001), higher total daily levodopa dose ( p < 0.001), and higher total updrs scores ( p = 0.005) than patients without dyskinesia. the three significant predictors of dyskinesia were duration of levodopa therapy, onset age, and total daily levodopa dose. conclusions: the prevalence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in our patients was 44%. the most significant predictors were duration of levodopa therapy, total daily levodopa dose, and onset age.;0;0;1;0

atm mutations and phenotypes in ataxia-telangiectasia families in the british isles: expression of mutant atm and the risk of leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer.;"we report the spectrum of 59 atm mutations observed in ataxia-telangiectasia ( a-t ) patients in the british isles . of 51 atm mutations identified in families native to the british isles , 11 were founder mutations , and 2 of these 11 conferred a milder clinical phenotype with respect to both cerebellar degeneration and cellular features . we report , in two a-t families , an atm mutation ( 7271t-- > g ) that may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both homozygotes and heterozygotes ( relative risk 12 . 7 ; p = . 0025 ) , although there is a less severe a-t phenotype in terms of the degree of cerebellar degeneration . this mutation ( 7271t-- > g ) also allows expression of full-length atm protein at a level comparable with that in unaffected individuals . in addition , we have studied 18 a-t patients , in 15 families , who developed leukemia , lymphoma , preleukemic t-cell proliferation , or hodgkin lymphoma , mostly in childhood . a wide variety of atm mutation types , including missense mutations and in-frame deletions , were seen in these patients . we also show that 25 % of all a-t patients carried in-frame deletions or missense mutations , many of which were also associated with expression of mutant atm protein .";0;0;1;1
pharmacology of acc-9653 (phenytoin prodrug).;acc-9653, the disodium phosphate ester of 3-hydroxymethyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin, is a prodrug of phenytoin with advantageous physicochemical properties. acc-9653 is rapidly converted enzymatically to phenytoin in vivo. acc-9653 and phenytoin sodium have equivalent anticonvulsant activity against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (mes) in mice following i.p., oral, or i.v. administration. the ed50 doses were 16 mg/kg for i.v. acc-9653 and 8 mg/kg for i.v. phenytoin sodium. acc-9653 and phenytoin sodium have similar antiarrhythmic activity against ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia in anesthetized dogs. the total doses of acc-9653 or phenytoin sodium necessary to convert the arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm were 24 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 3 mg/kg, respectively. only phenytoin sodium displayed in vitro antiarrhythmic activity against strophanthidin-induced arrhythmias in guinea pig right atria. in anesthetized dogs, a high dose of acc-9653 (31 mg/kg) was infused over 15, 20, and 30 min and the responses were compared to an equimolar dose of phenytoin sodium (21 mg/kg). the acc-9653 and phenytoin sodium treatments produced similar marked reductions in diastolic blood pressure and contractile force (lvdp/dt). the maximum effects of each treatment occurred at the time of maximum phenytoin sodium levels. acute toxicity studies of acc-9653 and phenytoin sodium were carried out in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs by i.v., i.m., and i.p. routes of administration. the systemic toxic signs of both agents were similar and occurred at approximately equivalent doses. importantly, the local irritation of acc-9653 was markedly less than phenytoin sodium following i.m. administration.(abstract truncated at 250 words);1;0;1;0

effects of deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane on neuropsychological function.;the effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients. twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane (hypotensive group). seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group. the mean arterial pressure was 77 +/- 2 mmhg (10.3 +/- 0.3 kpa) before hypotension and 50 +/- 0 mmhg (6.7 +/- 0.0 kpa) during hypotension in the hypotensive group, and 86 +/- 2 mmhg (11.5 +/- 0.3 kpa) during anaesthesia in the control group. the following psychological tests were performed: four subtests of the wechsler adult intelligence scale (similarities, digit span, vocabulary and digit symbol), trail-making tests a and b, zung tests (self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale) and two-part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall. the tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively. there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value. the results indicate that hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia.;0;0;1;0
warfarin-induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin d.;the present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin d treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of warfarin to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of matrix gla protein, a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall. the first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in warfarin-treated rats. treatment for 2 weeks with warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42-day-old rats. in contrast, no artery calcification could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of warfarin treatment. to directly examine the importance of growth to warfarin-induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification, with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to warfarin-induced artery calcification, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats. this observation suggests that increased susceptibility to warfarin-induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels. the second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin d and warfarin in artery calcification. high doses of vitamin d are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days. high doses of the vitamin k antagonist warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. in the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin d-treated rats at 3 and 4 days. there was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin d dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin d dose on the elevation of serum calcium, which suggests that vitamin d may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium. because warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin d, the synergy between warfarin and vitamin d is probably best explained by the hypothesis that warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix gla protein as a calcification inhibitor. high levels of matrix gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin d plus warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated. these observations indicate that although the gamma-carboxyglutamate residues of matrix gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites.;1;0;0;0
chemokine ccl2 and its receptor ccr2 are increased in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus.;background: neuroinflammation occurs after seizures and is implicated in epileptogenesis. ccr2 is a chemokine receptor for ccl2 and their interaction mediates monocyte infiltration in the neuroinflammatory cascade triggered in different brain pathologies. in this work ccr2 and ccl2 expression were examined following status epilepticus (se) induced by pilocarpine injection. methods: se was induced by pilocarpine injection. control rats were injected with saline instead of pilocarpine. five days after se, ccr2 staining in neurons and glial cells was examined using imunohistochemical analyses. the number of ccr2 positive cells was determined using stereology probes in the hippocampus. ccl2 expression in the hippocampus was examined by molecular assay. results: increased ccr2 was observed in the hippocampus after se. seizures also resulted in alterations to the cell types expressing ccr2. increased numbers of neurons that expressed ccr2 was observed following se. microglial cells were more closely apposed to the ccr2-labeled cells in se rats. in addition, rats that experienced se exhibited ccr2-labeling in populations of hypertrophied astrocytes, especially in ca1 and dentate gyrus. these ccr2+ astroctytes were not observed in control rats. examination of ccl2 expression showed that it was elevated in the hippocampus following se. conclusion: the data show that ccr2 and ccl2 are up-regulated in the hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced se. seizures also result in changes to ccr2 receptor expression in neurons and astrocytes. these changes might be involved in detrimental neuroplasticity and neuroinflammatory changes that occur following seizures.;0;0;1;0

combination of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (vtd) as a consolidation therapy after autologous stem cell transplantation for symptomatic multiple myeloma in japanese patients.;consolidation therapy for patients with multiple myeloma (mm) has been widely adopted to improve treatment response following autologous stem cell transplantation. in this study, we retrospectively analyzed the safety and efficacy of combination regimen of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (vtd) as consolidation therapy in 24 japanese patients with newly diagnosed mm. vtd consisted of bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m(2) and dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 35-day cycle, with daily oral thalidomide at a dose of 100 mg/day. grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were documented in four and three patients (17 and 13 %), respectively, but drug dose reduction due to cytopenia was not required in any case. peripheral neuropathy was common (63 %), but severe grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy was not observed. very good partial response or better response (>vgpr) rates before and after consolidation therapy were 54 and 79 %, respectively. patients had a significant probability of improving from <vgpr before consolidation therapy to >vgpr after consolidation therapy (p = 0.041). the vtd regimen may be safe and effective as a consolidation therapy in the treatment of mm in japanese population.;0;0;1;0

g130v, a common frda point mutation, appears to have arisen from a common founder.;friedreich ataxia ( frda ) is the most common inherited ataxia . about 98 % of mutant alleles have an expansion of a gaa trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the affected gene , frda . the other 2 % are point mutations . of the 17 point mutations so far described , three appear to be more common . one of these is the g130v mutation in exon 4 of frda . g130v , when present with an expanded gaa repeat on the other allele , is associated with an atypical frda phenotype . haplotype analysis was undertaken on the four families who have been described with this mutation . the results suggest a common founder for this mutation . although marked differences in extragenic marker haplotypes were seen in one family , similar intragenic haplotyping suggests the same mutation founder for this family with the differences explicable by two recombination events . .;0;0;1;0
interstrain variation in acute toxic response to caffeine among inbred mice.;"acute toxic dosage-dependent behavioral effects of caffeine were compared in adult males from seven inbred mouse strains (a/j, balb/cj, cba/j, c3h/hej, c57bl/6j, dba/2j, swr/j). c57bl/6j, chosen as a ""prototypic"" mouse strain, was used to determine behavioral responses to a broad range (5-500 mg/kg) of caffeine doses. five phenotypic characteristics--locomotor activity, righting ability, clonic seizure induction, stress-induced lethality, death without external stress--were scored at various caffeine doses in drug-naive animals under empirically optimized, rigidly constant experimental conditions. mice (n = 12 for each point) received single ip injections of a fixed volume/g body weight of physiological saline carrier with or without caffeine in doses ranging from 125-500 mg/kg. loss of righting ability was scored at 1, 3, 5 min post dosing and at 5 min intervals thereafter for 20 min. in the same animals the occurrence of clonic seizures was scored as to time of onset and severity for 20 min after drug administration. when these proceeded to tonic seizures, death occurred in less than 20 min. animals surviving for 20 min were immediately stressed by a swim test in 25 degrees c water, and death-producing tonic seizures were scored for 2 min. in other animals locomotor activity was measured 15 or 60 min after caffeine administration. by any single behavioral criterion or a combination of these criteria, marked differences in response to toxic caffeine doses were observed between strains. these results indicate that behavioral toxicity testing of alkylxanthines in a single mouse strain may be misleading and suggest that toxic responses of the central nervous system to this class of compounds are genetically influenced in mammals.";0;0;1;0
acute renal failure associated with prolonged intake of slimming pills containing anthraquinones.;chinese herbal medicine preparations are widely available and often regarded by the public as natural and safe remedies for a variety of medical conditions. nephropathy caused by chinese herbs has previously been reported, usually involving the use of aristolochic acids. we report a 23-year-old woman who developed acute renal failure following prolonged use of a proprietary chinese herbal slimming pill that contained anthraquinone derivatives, extracted from rhizoma rhei (rhubarb). the renal injury was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac. renal pathology was that of hypocellular interstitial fibrosis. spontaneous renal recovery occurred upon cessation of the slimming pills, but mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was still evident histologically 4 months later. although a causal relationship between the use of an anthraquinone-containing herbal agent and renal injury remains to be proven, phytotherapy-associated interstitial nephropathy should be considered in patients who present with unexplained renal failure.;0;1;0;0
the protective role of nrf2 in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.;objective: diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ros). nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy. research design and methods: we explore the protective role of nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy model in nrf2(-/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells. results: the glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated nrf2 levels. in the animal study, nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin-induced renal damage. this is evident by nrf2(-/-) mice having higher ros production and suffering from greater oxidative dna damage and renal injury compared with nrf2(+/+) mice. mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the nrf2-mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (tgf-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production. in human renal mesangial cells, high glucose induced ros production and activated expression of nrf2 and its downstream genes. furthermore, activation or overexpression of nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of tgf-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of nrf2 by sirna enhanced tgf-beta1 transcription and fibronectin production. conclusions: this work clearly indicates a protective role of nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy.;0;1;1;0
glepp1 receptor tyrosine phosphatase (ptpro) in rat pan nephrosis. a marker of acute podocyte injury.;glomerular epithelial protein 1 (glepp1) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes. this receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process. to better understand the utility of glepp1 as a marker of glomerular injury, the amount and distribution of glepp1 protein and mrna were examined by immunohistochemistry, western blot and rnase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat. puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (pan, 20 mg/100g bw). tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after pan injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement (days 5-11) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis (days 45-126). at day 5, glepp1 protein and mrna were reduced from the normal range (265.2 +/- 79.6 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus and 100%) to 15% of normal (41.8 +/- 4.8 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus, p < 0.005). this occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1.8 +/- 1 to 99.0 +/- 61 mg/day (p < 0.001). in contrast, podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time. by day 11, glepp1 protein and mrna had begun to return towards baseline. by day 45-126, at a time when glomerular scarring was present, glepp1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of glepp1 was not different from normal. we conclude that glepp1 expression, unlike podocalyxin, reflects podocyte injury induced by pan. glepp1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury.;0;1;0;0
transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with expanded ctg repeat mimic closely the dm ctg repeat intergenerational and somatic instability.;myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) is caused by a ctg repeat expansion in the 3utr of the dm protein kinase ( dmpk ) gene . a very high level of instability is observed through successive generations and the size of the repeat is generally correlated with the severity of the disease and with age at onset . furthermore , tissues from dm patients exhibit somatic mosaicism that increases with age . we generated transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with 20 , 55 or > 300 ctg , cloned from patients from the same affected dm family . using large human flanking sequences and a large amplification , we demonstrate that the intergenerational ctg repeat instability is reproduced in mice , with a strong bias towards expansions and with the same sex- and size-dependent characteristics as in humans . moreover , a high level of instability , increasing with age , can be observed in tissues and in sperm . although we did not observe dramatic expansions ( or big jumps over several hundred ctg repeats ) as in congenital forms of dm , our model carrying > 300 ctg is the first to show instability so close to the human dm situation . our three models carrying different sizes of ctg repeat provide insight on the different factors modulating the ctg repeat instability . .;0;0;1;0

the role of nicotine in smoking-related cardiovascular disease.;nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease. animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect. almost certainly, nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events, although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide. nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans. clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events. finally, the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat, suggesting that if nicotine is involved, adverse effects might be seen with relatively low-level cigarette exposures.;1;0;0;0

dexmedetomidine, acting through central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, prevents opiate-induced muscle rigidity in the rat.;"the highly-selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (d-med) is capable of inducing muscle flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs. intense generalized muscle rigidity is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists. although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced rigidity has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism. in the present study, the authors determined if treatment with d-med prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high-dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat. animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) l-med (the inactive l-isomer of medetomidine), 30 micrograms/kg; 2) d-med, 10 micrograms/kg; 3) d-med, 30 micrograms/kg; 4) d-med [30 micrograms/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, idazoxan [10 mg/kg]; 5) d-med [30 micrograms/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist dg-5128 [10 mg/kg], or; 6) saline. baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment. each rat was then injected with alfentanil (alf, 0.5 mg/kg sc). alf injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb emg activity in the l-med treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline. in contrast, d-med prevented alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity in a dose-dependent fashion. the small emg values obtained in the high-dose d-med group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate. the high-dose d-med animals were flaccid, akinetic, and lacked a startle response during the entire experimental period.(abstract truncated at 250 words)";0;0;1;0
subjective assessment of sexual dysfunction of patients on long-term administration of digoxin.;various data suggest that male patients who have received digoxin on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone (lh). this study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of digoxin therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of digoxin on plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and lh. the patients of the study and control group (without digoxin) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients. a subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out, using parameters such as sexual desire, sexual excitement, and frequency of sexual relations. personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior. the findings support the reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma estradiol, testosterone, and lh. the differences in the means were significant. tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant decrease in sexual desire, sexual excitement phase (erection), and frequency of sexual relations in the study group.;1;0;0;0

cardiovascular risk with cyclooxygenase inhibitors: general problem with substance specific differences?;randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. a comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. diagnostic markers such as n-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) or high-sensitive c-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity.;1;1;1;0

calcineurin-inhibitor induced pain syndrome (cips): a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation.;bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases. treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain. nine patients with severe pain in their feet, which was registered after transplantation, were investigated. bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones. magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones. pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain, like reflex sympathetic dystrophy, polyneuropathy, morton's neuralgia, gout, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, intermittent claudication, orthopaedic foot deformities, stress fractures, and hyperparathyroidism. the reduction of cyclosporine- or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain. the calcineurin-inhibitor induced pain syndrome (cips) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans. incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from cips.;0;0;1;0
drug-induced arterial spasm relieved by lidocaine. case report.;following major intracranial surgery in a 35-year-old man, sodium pentothal was intravenously infused to minimize cerebral ischaemia. intense vasospasm with threatened gangrene arose in the arm used for the infusion. since the cranial condition precluded use of more usual methods, lidocaine was given intra-arterially, with careful cardiovascular monitoring, to counteract the vasospasm. the treatment was rapidly successful.;1;0;0;0

further mapping of an ataxia-telangiectasia locus to the chromosome 11q23 region.;we recently mapped the gene for ataxia-telangiectasia group a ( ata ) to chromosome 11q22-23 by linkage analysis , using the genetic markers thy1 and pynb3 . 12 ( d11s144 ) . the most likely order was cent-at-s144-thy1 . the present paper describes further mapping of the at locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cm in the 11q22-23 region centered around s144 and thy1 . location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [ s144-thy1 ] segment , as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to thy1 , are each unlikely to contain the at locus , while the more centromeric [ stmy-s144 ] segment is most likely to contain the at locus . these data , together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11q22-23 , place the at locus at 11q23 .;0;0;1;0
cauda equina syndrome after epidural steroid injection: a case report.;objective: conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral radiculopathy are physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, oral medications, and spinal manipulative therapy. cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia. the following case is a report of cauda equina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine. clinical features: a 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection. intervention and outcome: an 18-gauge touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the l4-5 level. spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging. after verifying the epidural space, bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injected. after the injection, there was a reduction in radicular symptoms. three hours later, she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity weakness. the neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg. there was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test. deep-tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg. she was unable to urinate. the patient's symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours. she had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling foley catheter. all of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours. conclusion: complications associated with epidural steroid injections are rare. clinical examination and continued vigilance for neurologic deterioration after epidural steroid injections is important.;0;0;1;0
development of proteinuria after switch to sirolimus-based immunosuppression in long-term cardiac transplant patients.;"calcineurin-inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients. the novel immunosuppressive (is) drug sirolmus (srl) lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with srl has been reported following renal transplantation. in cardiac transplantation, the incidence of proteinuria associated with srl is unknown. in this study, long-term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to srl-based is. concomitant is consisted of mycophenolate mofetil +/- steroids. proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0.13 g/day (range 0-5.7) preswitch to 0.23 g/day (0-9.88) at 24 months postswitch (p = 0.0024). before the switch, 11.5% of patients had high-grade proteinuria (>1.0 g/day); this increased to 22.9% postswitch (p = 0.006). ace inhibitor and angiotensin-releasing blocker (arb) therapy reduced proteinuria development. patients without proteinuria had increased renal function (median 42.5 vs. 64.1, p = 0.25), whereas patients who developed high-grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow-up (median 39.6 vs. 29.2, p = 0.125). thus, proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to srl, which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients. srl should be used with acei/arb therapy and patients monitored for proteinuria and increased renal dysfunction.";1;1;0;0
phenytoin encephalopathy as probable idiosyncratic reaction: case report.;a case of phenytoin (dph) encephalopathy with increasing seizures and eeg and mental changes is described. despite adequate oral dosage of dph (5 mg/kg/daily) the plasma level was very low (2.8 microgramg/ml). the encephalopathy was probably an idiosyncratic and not toxic or allergic reaction. in fact the concentration of free dph was normal, the patient presented a retarded morbilliform rash during dph treatment, the protidogram was normal, and an intradermic dph injection had no local effect. the authors conclude that in a patient starting dph treatment an unexpected increase in seizures, with eeg and mental changes occurring simultaneously, should alert the physician to the possible need for eliminating dph from the therapeutic regimen, even if plasma concentrations are low.;0;0;1;0

risks of the consumption of beverages containing quinine.;although the united states food and drug administration banned its use for nocturnal leg cramps due to lack of safety and efficacy, quinine is widely available in beverages including tonic water and bitter lemon. numerous anecdotal reports suggest that products containing quinine may produce neurological complications, including confusion, altered mental status, seizures, and coma, particularly in older women. psychologists need to inquire about consumption of quinine-containing beverages as part of an evaluation process.;0;0;1;0
the long-term safety of danazol in women with hereditary angioedema.;although the short-term safety (less than or equal to 6 months) of danazol has been established in a variety of settings, no information exists as to its long-term safety. we therefore investigated the long-term safety of danazol by performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with hereditary angioedema treated with danazol for a continuous period of 6 months or longer. the mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 59.7 months. virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions. menstrual abnormalities (79%), weight gain (60%), muscle cramps/myalgias (40%), and transaminase elevations (40%) were the most common adverse reactions. the drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients. no patient has died or suffered any apparent long-term sequelae that were directly attributable to the drug. we conclude that, despite a relatively high incidence of adverse reactions, danazol has proven to be remarkably safe over the long-term in this group of patients.;0;1;0;0

efficacy and proarrhythmia with the use of d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.;"this study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy, the incidence of torsades de pointes, and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. eighty-one consecutive patients (54 with coronary artery disease, and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d,l-sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia. during oral loading with d,l-sotalol, continuous electrocardiographic (ecg) monitoring was performed. those patients in whom d,l-sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 +/- 18 months. induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d,l-sotalol in 35 (43%) patients; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 (49%) patients; and two (2.5%) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d,l-sotalol once daily. four (5%) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d,l-sotalol. neither ecg [sinus-cycle length (scl), qt or qtc interval, or u wave] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes. however, the oral dose of d,l-sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes (200 +/- 46 vs. 328 +/- 53 mg/day; p = 0.0017). risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an u wave (p = 0.049), female gender (p = 0.015), and significant dose-corrected changes of scl, qt interval, and qtc interval (p < 0.05). during follow-up, seven (20%) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence, and two (6%) patients died suddenly. one female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d,l-sotalol. torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d,l-sotalol. pronounced changes in the surface ecg (cycle length, qt, and qtc) in relation to the dose of oral d,l-sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes. other ecg parameters before the application of d,l-sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes. recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation. therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d,l-sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value.";1;0;1;0

heterozygous loss of six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular cataracts.;"myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal muscle wasting , myotonia , cardiac arrhythmia , hyperinsulinaemia , mental retardation and ocular cataracts . the genetic defect in dm is a ctg repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of dmpk and 5 of a homeodomain-encoding gene , six5 ( formerly dmahp ; refs 2-5 ) . there are three mechanisms by which ctg expansion can result in dm . first , repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant dmpk mrna and consequently reduce dmpk levels . second , ctg expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease six5 transcription . third , toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of dna or rna ( refs 10 , 11 ) . previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of dm15 ( the mouse dmpk homologue ) in mice produces a partial dm phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders . to test the role of six5 loss in dm , we have analysed a strain of mice in which six5 was deleted . our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to six5 dosage and is temporally progressive . six5 + / - and six5- / - mice show increased steady-state levels of the na + / k + -atpase alpha-1 subunit and decreased dm15 mrna levels . thus , altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation . as ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of dm , these results demonstrate that decreased six5 transcription is important in the aetiology of dm . our data support the hypothesis that dm is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both dmpk and six5 . .";1;0;1;0

clonazepam monotherapy for epilepsy in childhood.;sixty patients (age-range one month to 14 years) with other types of epilepsy than infantile spasms were treated with clonazepam. disappearance of seizures and normalization of abnormal eeg with disappearance of seizures were recognized in 77% and 50%, respectively. seizures disappeared in 71% of the patients with generalized seizures and 89% of partial seizures. improvement of abnormal eeg was noticed in 76% of diffuse paroxysms and in 67% of focal paroxysms. in excellent cases, mean effective dosages were 0.086 +/- 0.021 mg/kg/day in infants and 0.057 +/- 0.022 mg/kg/day in schoolchildren, this difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.005). the incidence of side effects such as drowsiness and ataxia was only 5%.;0;0;1;0
clarithromycin-induced ventricular tachycardia.;clarithromycin is a relatively new macrolide antibiotic that offers twice-daily dosing. it differs from erythromycin only in the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 6. although the side-effect profile of erythromycin is established, including gastroenteritis and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed-function oxidase metabolism, experience with the newer macrolides is still being recorded. cardiotoxicity has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of erythromycin but has never been reported with the newer macrolides. we report a case of ventricular dysrhythmias that occurred after six therapeutic doses of clarithromycin. the dysrhythmias resolved after discontinuation of the drug.;1;1;0;0
prolonged paralysis due to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids.;the long-term use of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (nd-nmba) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged muscle weakness, although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear. we report 3 patients (age 37-52 years) with acute respiratory insufficiency who developed prolonged weakness following the discontinuation of nd-nmbas. two patients also received intravenous corticosteroids. renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients, and all had acidosis. electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials, normal sensory studies, and fibrillations. repetitive stimulation at 2 hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients. the serum vecuronium level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng/ml. a muscle biopsy in this patient showed loss of thick, myosin filaments. the weakness in these patients is due to pathology at both the neuromuscular junction (most likely due to nd-nmba) and muscle (most likely due to corticosteroids). hepatic dysfunction and acidosis are contributing risk factors.;0;1;1;0
adult onset globoid cell leukodystrophy (krabbe disease): analysis of galactosylceramidase cdna from four japanese patients.;"we examined galactosylceramidase ( galc ) cdna in four japanese patients with adult onset globoid cell leukodystrophy ( krabbe disease ; ao-gld ) by polymerase chain reaction / single-strand conformation polymorphism ( pcr-sscp ) analysis , subsequent sequence determination , and restriction enzyme digestion of pcr products , initial symptoms were the onset of slowly progressive spastic paraplegia from the middle of the second decade , and all patients had diminished galc activity in their leukocytes . we identified three missense mutations ( i66m , g270d , l618s ) and one exon-6 skipping ( 535-573del ) . two of the patients had only the i66m mutant mrna , and one only the g27od mutant mrna . the fourth patient carried a compound heterozygous mutation of 535-573del and l618s . to determine the enzymatic activities produced by these mutations , we constructed mutated galc cdnas and expressed them in cos-1 cells . three mutations , viz . , g270d , l618s , and exon-6 skipping ( 535-573del ) , produced diminished galc activity as expected . the i66m mutation in the wild-type galc cdna ( i289 ) had normal activity , but when this mutation and the v289 polymorphism were introduced into the same allele , it had decreased activity . thus , the combination of a unique mutation and polymorphism causes conformational change in the galc enzyme , resulting in low enzymatic activity . ao-gld mutations , including those found here , are located in the n-terminus ( i66m , g270d , 535-573del ) or c-terminus ( l618s ) of the galc enzyme , whereas the reported mutations in the infantile form ( if-gld ) are in the central domain . this difference in mutation sites may affect the clinical features of gld .";0;0;1;0

p53 inhibition exacerbates late-stage anthracycline cardiotoxicity.;aims: doxorubicin (dox) is an effective anti-cancer therapeutic, but is associated with both acute and late-stage cardiotoxicity. children are particularly sensitive to dox-induced heart failure. here, the impact of p53 inhibition on acute vs. late-stage dox cardiotoxicity was examined in a juvenile model. methods and results: two-week-old mhc-cb7 mice (which express dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes) and their non-transgenic (non-txg) littermates received weekly dox injections for 5 weeks (25 mg/kg cumulative dose). one week after the last dox treatment (acute stage), mhc-cb7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the non-txg mice. surprisingly, by 13 weeks following the last dox treatment (late stage), mhc-cb7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with non-txg mice. p53 inhibition blocked transient dox-induced stat3 activation in mhc-cb7 mice, which was associated with enhanced induction of the dna repair proteins ku70 and ku80. mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of stat3 exhibited worse cardiac function, higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and a greater induction of ku70 and ku80 in response to dox treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals. conclusion: these data support a model wherein a p53-dependent cardioprotective pathway, mediated via stat3 activation, mitigates dox-induced myocardial stress during drug delivery. furthermore, these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and, paradoxically, enhanced cardiotoxicity long after the cessation of drug treatment.;1;1;1;1

fear-potentiated startle, but not light-enhanced startle, is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs.;rationale and objectives: the light-enhanced startle paradigm (les) is suggested to model anxiety, because of the non-specific cue and the long-term effect. in contrast, the fear-potentiated startle (fps) is suggested to model conditioned fear. however, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar. the present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on les and fps and aimed at determining the sensitivity of les for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms. methods: male wistar rats received each dose of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.25-1.0mg/kg), the 5-ht(2c) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mcpp, 0.5-2.0mg/kg) or the gaba(a) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole (ptz, 3-30mg/kg) and were subsequently tested in either les or fps. results: none of the drugs enhanced les, whereas mcpp increased percentage fps and yohimbine increased absolute fps values. furthermore, yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the les, while mcpp suppressed baseline startle in both the les and fps and ptz suppressed baseline startle in the fps. conclusions: in contrast to findings in the fps paradigm, none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the les response. thus, a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between les and fps.;0;0;1;0

adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein can compensate functionally for adrenoleukodystrophy protein deficiency (x-ald): implications for therapy.;inherited defects in the peroxisomal atp-binding cassette ( abc ) transporter adrenoleukodystrophy protein ( aldp ) lead to the lethal peroxisomal disorder x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( x-ald ) , for which no efficient treatment has been established so far . three other peroxisomal abc transporters currently are known  adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein ( aldrp ) , 70 kda peroxisomal membrane protein ( pmp70 ) and pmp70- related protein . by using transient and stable overexpression of human cdnas encoding aldp and its closest relative aldrp , we could restore the impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation in fibroblasts of x-ald patients . the pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of aldrp in immortalized x-ald cells . immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of aldp by aldrp was not due to stabilization of the mutated aldp itself . moreover , we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect in the liver of aldp-deficient mice by stimulation of aldrp and pmp70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate . these results suggest that a correction of the biochemical defect in x-ald could be possible by drug-induced overexpression or ectopic expression of aldrp . .;0;1;1;0
valsartan, a new angiotensin ii antagonist for the treatment of essential hypertension: a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against amlodipine.;"objective: to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin ii antagonist, valsartan, with a reference therapy, amlodipine. methods: one hundred sixty-eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks. after 8 weeks of therapy, in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled, 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy. patients were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. the primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks. secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates. results: both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. similar decreases were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed. for the primary variable the difference was 0.5 mm hg in favor of valsartan (p = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 1.7). responder rates at 8 weeks were 66.7% for valsartan and 60.2% for amlodipine (p = 0.39). both treatments were well tolerated. the incidence of drug-related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day (2.4% for 80 mg valsartan; 3.6% for 5 mg amlodipine; 0% for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine; 14.3% for 10 mg amlodipine). conclusions: the data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. the results also show valsartan to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists.";1;0;0;0

clinically significant proteinuria following the administration of sirolimus to renal transplant recipients.;background: sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor (cni)-based regimens. to date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus. we have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use. in each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria. methods: we analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the washington hospital center between 1999-2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. in these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria/day. laboratory results were compared between prior, during and following sirolimus use. results: twenty-eight patients (24%) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post-transplantation course. in 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive. in 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria. proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. in most patients, discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of proteinuria. conclusions: sirolimus induces or aggravates pre-existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. proteinuria may improve, but does not resolve, when sirolimus is withdrawn.;0;1;1;0

the 3-week sulphasalazine syndrome strikes again.;"a 34-year-old lady developed a constellation of dermatitis, fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatitis, beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral sulphasalazine for sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis. cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis, associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates, without viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an adverse drug reaction.a week later, fulminant drug-induced hepatitis, associated with the presence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of autoimmunity), and accompanied by multi-organ failure and sepsis, supervened. she subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy.post-mortem examination showed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis, acute hypersensitivity myocarditis, focal acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow necrosis, with no evidence of malignancy. it is thought that the clinico-pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so-called ""3-week sulphasalazine syndrome"", a rare, but often fatal, immunoallergic reaction to sulphasalazine.";0;1;0;0

acute renal failure subsequent to the administration of rifampicin. a follow-up study of cases reported earlier.;a clinical presentation is made of a 2-3 year follow-up of six cases of acute renal failure that have been reported earlier. the patients had developed transient renal failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin. the stage of olig-anuria lasted for 1-3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis. two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow-up period. the four patients re-examined were clinically cured. pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce. nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied. renal function was normal. in three cases the excretion at 131i-hippuran renography was slightly slowed. although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic, evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded.;0;1;0;0
methimazole-induced cholestatic jaundice.;methimazole is a widely used and generally well-tolerated antithyroid agent. a 43-year-old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole (10 mg tid) and propranolol (20 mg tid) for treatment of hyperthyroidism. the patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medications. when seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later, she still had severe icterus, pruritus, and hyperbilirubinemia, formed mainly of the conjugated fraction. methimazole-induced cholestasis was diagnosed, and propranolol therapy was resumed. over the following 9 days, the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without methimazole. in rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy, this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaundice. physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that, upon occurrence, they can discontinue methimazole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.;0;0;1;0
mutation of msh3 in endometrial cancer and evidence for its functional role in heteroduplex repair.;many human tumours have length alterations in repetitive sequence elements . although this microsatellite instability has been attributed to mutations in four dna mismatch repair genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( hnpcc ) kindreds , many sporadic tumours exhibit instability but no detectable mutations in these genes . it is therefore of interest to identify other genes that contribute to this instability . in yeast , mutations in several genes , including rth and msh3 , cause microsatellite instability . thus , we screened 16 endometrial carcinomas with microsatellite instability for alterations in fen1 ( the human homolog of rth ) and in msh3 ( refs 12-14 ) . although we found no fen1 mutations , a frameshift mutation in msh3 was observed in an endometrial carcinoma and in an endometrial carcinoma cell line . extracts of the cell line were deficient in repair of dna substrates containing mismatches or extra nucleotides . introducing chromosome 5 , encoding the msh3 gene , into the mutant cell line increased the stability of some but not all microsatellites . extracts of these cells repaired certain substrates containing extra nucleotides , but were deficient in repair of those containing mismatches or other extra nucleotides . a subsequent search revealed a second gene mutation in hhua cells , a missense mutation in the msh6 gene . together the data suggest that the msh3 gene encodes a product that functions in repair of some but not all pre-mutational intermediates , its mutation in tumours can result in genomic instability and , as in yeast , msh3 and msh6 are partially redundant for mismatch repair . .;0;0;1;1

metabolic involvement in adriamycin cardiotoxicity.;the cardiotoxic effects of adriamycin were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system. adriamycin inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture. a possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously, and in this study the adenylate energy charge and phosphorylcreatine mole fraction were determined in the adriamycin-treated cells. the adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased, while the phophorylcreatine mole fraction was unchanged. such disparity suggests an inhibition of creatine phosphokinase. the addition of 1 mm adenosine to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the atp concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized atp pool. in the adriamycin-treated cells, the addition of adenosine increased the adenylate charge and, concomitant with this inrcease, the cells' functional integrity, in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions, was maintained.;1;0;1;0

effects of aminophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular fibrillation during respiratory failure.;"cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure. the possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized. the effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs. the ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. during the infusion of aminophylline, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when ph and partial pressures of oxygen (po2) and carbon dioxide (co2) were kept within normal limits. when respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation (ph 7.05 to 7.25; pc02 70 to 100 mm hg: p02 20 to 40 mm hg), infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level. these experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure, pharmacologic agents, particularly aminophylline, may play a significant role.";1;0;0;0
effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy: behavioral and electrophysiological studies.;objective: the globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation. previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum, and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects. the present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian symptoms. methods: behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study. results: bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats. electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration. the neurotensin type-1 receptor antagonist sr48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin. conclusion: activation of pallidal neurotensin receptors may be involved in neurotensin-induced antiparkinsonian effects.;0;0;1;0

nephrotoxic effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography.;"background: the use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy. whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. methods: we conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol. the study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. the primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography. other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7. results: the creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol. from day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (p=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (p=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). no patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did. the mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (p=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). conclusions: nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.";1;1;0;0
friedreich ataxia: an overview.;friedreich ataxia , an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease , is the most common of the inherited ataxias . the recent discovery of the gene that is mutated in this condition , frda , has led to rapid advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of friedreich ataxia . about 98 % of mutant alleles have an expansion of a gaa trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene . this leads to reduced levels of the protein , frataxin . there is mounting evidence to suggest that friedreich ataxia is the result of accumulation of iron in mitochondria leading to excess production of free radicals , which then results in cellular damage and death . currently there is no known treatment that alters the natural course of the disease . the discovery of the frda gene and its possible function has raised hope that rational therapeutic strategies will be developed . .;0;0;1;0
genomic structure of the ews gene and its relationship to ewsr1, a site of tumor-associated chromosome translocation.;"the ews gene has been identified based on its location at the chromosome 22 breakpoint of the t ( 11 ; 22 ) ( q24 ; q12 ) translocation that characterizes ewing sarcoma and related neuroectodermal tumors . the ews gene spans about 40 kb of dna and is encoded by 17 exons . the nucleotide sequence of the exons is identical to that of the previously described cdna . the first 7 exons encode the n-terminal domain of ews , which consists of a repeated degenerated polypeptide of 7 to 12 residues rich in tyrosine , serine , threonine , glycine , and glutamine . exons 11 , 12 , and 13 encode the putative rna binding domain . the three glycine- and arginine-rich motifs of the gene are mainly encoded by exons 8-9 , 14 , and 16 . the dna sequence in the 5 region of the gene has features of a cpg-rich island and lacks canonical promoter elements , such as tata and ccaat consensus sequences . positions of the chromosome 22 breakpoints were determined for 19 ewing tumors . they were localized in introns 7 or 8 in 18 cases and in intron 10 in 1 case . .";0;0;1;1
neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride in a japanese patient with huntington's disease at the terminal stage of recurrent breast cancer.;we herein describe the case of an 81-year-old japanese woman with neuroleptic malignant syndrome that occurred 36 days after the initiation of combination therapy with tiapride (75 mg/day) and tetrabenazine (12.5 mg/day) for huntington's disease. the patient had been treated with tiapride or tetrabenazine alone without any adverse effects before the administration of the combination therapy. she also had advanced breast cancer when the combination therapy was initiated. to the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride has not been previously reported. tetrabenazine should be administered very carefully in combination with other neuroleptic drugs, particularly in patients with a worsening general condition.;0;0;1;1
missense mutation in the alternative splice region of the pax6 gene in eye anomalies.;the pax6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis , and pax6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies , including aniridia , peters anomaly , corneal dystrophy , congenital cataract , and foveal hypoplasia . the gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type dna-binding domain . the paired domain is composed of two distinct dna-binding subdomains , the n-terminal subdomain ( nts ) and the c-terminal subdomain ( cts ) , which bind respective consensus dna sequences . the human pax6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain . the insertion , into the nts , of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the dna-binding activity of the nts and unmasks the dna-binding ability of the cts . thus , exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes . we ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with peters anomaly , congenital cataract , axenfeldt anomaly , and / or foveal hypoplasia , which , to our knowledge , is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region . a t-- > a transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a val-- > asp ( gtc-- > gac ) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region . functional analyses demonstrated that the v54d mutation slightly increased nts binding and decreased cts transactivation activity to almost half . .;0;0;1;0

myocardial infarction in pregnancy associated with clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction: a case report.;background: clomiphene citrate (cc) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction. it is considered safe, with minimal side effects. thromboembolism is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with cc. spontaneous coronary thrombosis or thromboembolism with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of myocardial infarction (mi) during pregnancy, with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram. case: a 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received cc for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain. an electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall myocardial infarction. cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin i to 9.10 ng/ml. an initial exercise stress test was normal. at the time of admission, the patient was at high risk of radiation injury to the fetus, so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester. it showed normal coronary vessels. conclusion: this appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between cc and myocardial infarction. thrombosis might be a rare but hazardous complication of cc. given this life-threatening complication, appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high-risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation.;1;0;0;0

accurate patient history contributes to differentiating diabetes insipidus: a case study.;this case study highlights the important contribution of nursing in obtaining an accurate health history. the case discussed herein initially appeared to be neurogenic diabetes insipidus (di) secondary to a traumatic brain injury. the nursing staff, by reviewing the patient's health history with his family, discovered a history of polydipsia and long-standing lithium use. lithium is implicated in drug-induced nephrogenic di, and because the patient had not received lithium since being admitted to the hospital, his treatment changed to focus on nephrogenic di. by combining information from the patient history, the physical examination, and radiologic and laboratory studies, the critical care team demonstrated that the patient had been self-treating his lithium-induced nephrogenic di and developed neurogenic di secondary to brain trauma. thus successful treatment required that nephrogenic and neurogenic di be treated concomitantly.;0;1;1;0

5-azacytidine potentiates initiation induced by carcinogens in rat liver.;to test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of dna plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process, 5-azacytidine (5-azc) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of dna methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), n-methyl-n-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-dmh) (100 mg/kg). the initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-gt) positive foci formed following a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of ccl4. the results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of 5-azc during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10-20 foci/cm2 in 5-azc and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only. administration of [3h]-5-azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1,2-dmh further showed that 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in dna were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of 5-azc occurs during repair synthesis. in the absence of the carcinogen, 5-azc given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma-gt positive foci. the results suggest that hypomethylation of dna per se may not be sufficient for initiation. perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation, the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of dna.;0;1;0;0

thalidomide neuropathy in patients treated for metastatic prostate cancer.;we prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using electrodiagnostic studies. sixty-seven men with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer in an open-label trial of oral thalidomide underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies (ncs) prior to and at 3-month intervals during treatment. ncs included recording of sensory nerve action potentials (snaps) from median, radial, ulnar, and sural nerves. snap amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline, and the mean of the four was termed the snap index. a 40% decline in the snap index was considered clinically significant. thalidomide was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response. of 67 patients initially enrolled, 24 remained on thalidomide for 3 months, 8 remained at 6 months, and 3 remained at 9 months. six patients developed neuropathy. clinical symptoms and a decline in the snap index occurred concurrently. older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors. neuropathy may thus be a common complication of thalidomide in older patients. the snap index can be used to monitor peripheral neuropathy, but not for early detection.;0;0;1;1

structural abnormalities in the brains of human subjects who use methamphetamine.;"we visualize, for the first time, the profile of structural deficits in the human brain associated with chronic methamphetamine (ma) abuse. studies of human subjects who have used ma chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral metabolic abnormalities. using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and new computational brain-mapping techniques, we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic ma abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to cognitive impairment. we used high-resolution mri and surface-based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used ma and 21 age-matched, healthy controls. cortical maps revealed severe gray-matter deficits in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices of ma abusers (averaging 11.3% below control; p < 0.05). on average, ma abusers had 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects (p < 0.01; left, p = 0.01; right, p < 0.05) and significant white-matter hypertrophy (7.0%; p < 0.01). hippocampal deficits were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word-recall test (p < 0.05). mri-based maps suggest that chronic methamphetamine abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory performance. ma may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and, consistent with metabolic studies, the cingulate-limbic cortex, inducing neuroadaptation, neuropil reduction, or cell death. prominent white-matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes, including gliosis secondary to neuronal damage. these brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of ma abuse, providing therapeutic targets for drug-induced brain injury.";1;0;1;0

nicotine potentiation of morphine-induced catalepsy in mice.;in the present study, effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated. morphine but not nicotine induced a dose-dependent catalepsy. the response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine. intraperitoneal administration of atropine, naloxone, mecamylamine, and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine. intracerebroventricular injection of atropine, hexamethonium, and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine. intraperitoneal administration of atropine, but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium, decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine. it was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors, and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms.;0;0;1;0
hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with ingestion of quinine.;hemolytic-uremic syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature. we describe a 5th case. the reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of quinine. treatment has included use of plasma exchange, prednisone, aspirin, and dipyridamole. the patients have all regained some degree of renal function. however, it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement. quinine-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome probably occurs more often than is recognized. it is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further quinine exposure, since the reaction seems to be recurrent.;0;1;1;0
intracranial pressure increases during alfentanil-induced rigidity.;intracranial pressure (icp) was measured during alfentanil-induced rigidity in rats. ten rats had arterial, central venous (cvp), and subdural cannulae inserted under halothane anesthesia. the animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia (pco2 = 42 +/- 1 mmhg, mean +/- se). following instrumentation, halothane was discontinued and alfentanil (125 mu/kg) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesia. in the five rats that developed somatic rigidity, icp and cvp increased significantly above baseline (delta icp 7.5 +/- 1.0 mmhg, delta cvp 5.9 +/- 1.3 mmhg). these variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with metocurine. in five rats that did not become rigid, icp and cvp did not change following alfentanil. these observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with icp problems.;0;0;1;0

prevention of breast cancer with tamoxifen: preliminary findings from the italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women. italian tamoxifen prevention study.;"background: tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer, although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer. therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive. methods: in october, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy. women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. the original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. in june, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. recruitment ended on july 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. the primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer. this preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. findings: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer. there is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms. there is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen. compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. interpretation: although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent. women using hormone-replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen. there were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study. it is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy.";0;0;1;1

toxic hepatitis induced by antithyroid drugs: four cases including one with cross-reactivity between carbimazole and benzylthiouracil.;objective: this study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with antithyroid drugs. methods: retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department (in- or out-patients) from 1986 to 1992. results: four patients (1.7%) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent. two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole (n  omercazole). two others had a mixed (cholestatic and cytolytic) hepatitis following carbimazole. one of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after benzylthiouracil (basd  ne) had replaced carbimazole. biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug, while biliary, viral and immunological searches were negative. only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia. conclusion: toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants, as for haematological disturbances, a pre-therapeutic determination and a careful follow-up of relevant biological markers. moreover, hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents.;0;1;0;0
expression and imprinting of magel2 suggest a role in prader-willi syndrome and the homologous murine imprinting phenotype.;prader-willi syndrome ( pws ) is caused by the loss of expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11-q13 . affected individuals exhibit neonatal hypotonia , developmental delay and childhood-onset obesity . necdin , a protein implicated in the terminal differentiation of neurons , is the only pws candidate gene to reduce viability when disrupted in a mouse model . in this study , we have characterized magel2 ( also known as ndnl1 ) , a gene with 51 % amino acid sequence similarity to necdin and located 41 kb distal to ndn in the pws deletion region . magel2 is expressed predominantly in brain , the primary tissue affected in pws and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis . magel2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain , and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a pws-affected individual . the orthologous mouse gene ( magel2 ) is located within 150 kb of ndn  , is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting , rt-pcr and whole-mount rna in situ hybridization . magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of ndn  , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization . we hypothesize that , although loss of necdin expression may be important in the neonatal presentation of pws , loss of magel2 may be critical to abnormalities in brain development and dysmorphic features in individuals with pws . .;0;0;1;0

acute renal failure after high-dose methotrexate therapy in a patient with ileostomy.;high-dose methotrexate (hd-mtx) is an important treatment for burkitt lymphoma, but can cause hepatic and renal toxicity when its clearance is delayed. we report a case of acute renal failure after hd-mtx therapy in a patient with ileostomy, the patient was a 3-year-old boy who had received a living-related liver transplantation for congenital biliary atresia. at day 833 after the transplantation, he was diagnosed with ptld (post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, burkitt-type malignant lymphoma). during induction therapy, he suffered ileal perforation and ileostomy was performed. subsequent hd-mtx therapy caused acute renal failure that required continuous hemodialysis. we supposed that intravascular hypovolemia due to substantial drainage from the ileostoma caused acute prerenal failure. after recovery of his renal function, we could safely treat the patient with hd-mtx therapy by controlling drainage from ileostoma with total parenteral nutrition.;0;1;0;1

dominant negative effect of the apc1309 mutation: a possible explanation for genotype-phenotype correlations in familial adenomatous polyposis.;inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis . patients with familial apc ( fap ) carry germ-line mutations in the apc gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life . the severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited apc mutation ( genotype-phenotype correlation ) . together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic apc mutations cluster in the central region of the apc gene , this points to a dominant negative effect of certain apc mutants . loss of apc function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin- / tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells . here , we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of apc gene products associated with severe polyposis . wild-type apc activity in beta-catenin- / tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant apc that is truncated at codon 1309 . in contrast , mutant apc gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis ( codon 386 or 1465 ) interfered only weakly with wild-type apc activity . these results suggest a molecular explanation for the genotype-phenotype correlation in fap patients and support the idea that colorectal tumor growth might be , in part , driven by selection for a mutation in the mutation cluster region . .;0;0;0;1
clinical comparison of cardiorespiratory effects during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia.;background: spinal anaesthesia is widely employed in clinical practice but has the main drawback of post-spinal block hypotension. efforts must therefore continue to be made to obviate this setback objective: to evaluate the cardiovascular and respiratory changes during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia. methods: with ethical approval, we studied 74 american society of anesthesiologists (asa), physical status class 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective unilateral lower limb surgery. patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups. in the lateral position with operative side down, patients recived 10 mg (2mls) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 25-gauge spinal needle. patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection. blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored over 1 hour. results: three patients (8.1%) in the unilateral group and 5 (13.5%) in the conventional group developed hypotension, p= 0.71. four (10.8%) patients in the conventional group and 1 (2.7%) in the unilateral group, p= 0.17 required epinephrine infusion to treat hypotension. patients in the conventional group had statistically significant greater fall in the systolic blood pressures at 15, 30 and 45 minutes when compared to the baseline (p= 0.003, 0.001 and 0.004). the mean respiratory rate and oxygen saturations in the two groups were similar. conclusion: compared to conventional spinal anaesthesia, unilateral spinal anaesthesia was associated with fewer cardiovascular perturbations. also, the type of spinal block instituted affected neither the respiratory rate nor the arterial oxygen saturation.;1;0;0;0

induction of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in a woman by exogenous androgen administration.;we documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens. when the androgens were withdrawn, the patient's physical changes, symptoms, sleep study, and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal. a rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. our report provides direct evidence for this role. structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep. development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy.;0;0;1;0

mechanism of increased iron absorption in murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis : increased duodenal expression of the iron transporter dmt1 .;hereditary hemochromatosis ( hh ) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tissue iron deposition secondary to excessive dietary iron absorption . we recently reported that hfe , the protein defective in hh , was physically associated with the transferrin receptor ( tfr ) in duodenal crypt cells and proposed that mutations in hfe attenuate the uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma by duodenal crypt cells , leading to up-regulation of transporters for dietary iron . here , we tested the hypothesis that hfe- / - mice have increased duodenal expression of the divalent metal transporter ( dmt1 ) . by 4 weeks of age , the hfe- / - mice demonstrated iron loading when compared with hfe + / + littermates , with elevated transferrin saturations ( 68 . 4 % vs . 49 . 8 % ) and elevated liver iron concentrations ( 985 micrograms vs . 381 micrograms ) . by using northern blot analyses , we quantitated duodenal expression of both classes of dmt1 transcripts  one containing an iron responsive element ( ire ) , called dmt1 ( ire ) , and one containing no ire , called dmt1 ( non-ire ) . the positive control for dmt1 up-regulation was a murine model of dietary iron deficiency that demonstrated greatly increased levels of duodenal dmt1 ( ire ) mrna . hfe- / - mice also demonstrated an increase in duodenal dmt1 ( ire ) mrna ( average 7 . 7-fold ) , despite their elevated transferrin saturation and hepatic iron content . duodenal expression of dmt1 ( non-ire ) was not increased , nor was hepatic expression of dmt1 increased . these data support the model for hh in which hfe mutations lead to inappropriately low crypt cell iron , with resultant stabilization of dmt1 ( ire ) mrna , up-regulation of dmt1 , and increased absorption of dietary iron .;0;1;1;0
phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces frontal lobe oxygenation following anesthesia-induced hypotension.;"background: vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia-induced hypotension. we describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (s(c)o(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension. methods: following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (map). heart rate (hr), map, stroke volume (sv), cardiac output (co), and frontal lobe oxygenation (s(c)o(2)) were registered. results: induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in map, hr, sv, and co concomitant with an elevation in s(c)o(2). after administration of phenylephrine, map increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmhg; p < 0.001; mean +/- sd). however, a 14% (from 70 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 7%) reduction in s(c)o(2) (p < 0.05) followed with no change in co (3.7 +/- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.9 l min(-1)). the administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in map (53 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 8 mmhg; p < 0.001), restored co (3.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.3 l min(-1)), and preserved s(c)o(2). conclusions: the utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on s(c)o(2) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in co.";1;0;0;0
serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine-induced psychosis in a japanese population.;background: altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. the serotonin 6 (5-ht6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-ht6 receptor antagonist. in addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-ht6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. these animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-ht6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. the symptoms of methamphetamine (meth)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-ht6 gene (htr6) with meth-induced psychosis. method: using five tagging snps (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 meth-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the japanese population. the age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients. results: rs6693503 was associated with meth-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. moreover, this association remained significant after bonferroni correction. in the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in htr6 and meth-induced psychosis patients, respectively. conclusion: htr6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of meth-induced psychosis in the japanese population.;0;0;1;0
severe-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency associated with chronic hemolytic anemia, granulocyte dysfunction, and increased susceptibility to infections: description of a new molecular variant (g6pd barcelona).;molecular , kinetic , and functional studies were carried out on erythrocytes and leukocytes in a spanish male with g6pd deficiency , congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia ( cnsha ) , and increased susceptibility to infections . g6pd activity was absent in patients red cells and was about 2 % of normal in leukocytes . molecular studies using standard methods ( who , 1967 ) showed g6pd in the patient to have a slightly fast electrophoretic mobility at ph 8 . 0 with otherwise normal properties ( heat stability at 46 degrees c , apparent affinity for substrates , optimum ph , and utilization of substrate analogues ) . other tests showed the patients granulocytes to engulf latex particles normally , but to have impaired reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and ferricytochrome-c as well as reduced iodination . chemotaxis and random migration of the patients granulocytes were normal as were myeloperoxidase , leukocyte alkaline phosphatase ( lap ) , and ultrastructural features . the molecular characteristics of g6pd in the patient differed from those of all previously reported variants associated with cnsha , so the present variant was provisionally called g6pd barcelona to distinguish it from other g6pd variants previously described . possible mechanisms for the severe deficiency of g6pd in erythrocytes and granulocytes was investigated by studies on the immunologic specific activity of the mutant enzyme .;0;0;1;0

increase in intragastric pressure during suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations in children: inhibition by alfentanil.;"changes in intragastric pressure after the administration of suxamethonium 1.5 mg kg-1 i.v. were studied in 32 children (mean age 6.9 yr) pretreated with either physiological saline or alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1. anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1. the incidence and intensity of muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium were significantly greater in the control than in the alfentanil group. the intragastric pressure during muscle fasciculations was significantly higher in the control group (16 +/- 0.7 (sem) cm h2o) than in the alfentanil group (7.7 +/- 1.5 (sem) cm h2o). the increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of muscle fasciculations (regression line: y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78). it is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium in healthy children. alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations; moreover, intragastric pressure remains at its control value.";0;0;1;0

anticonvulsant actions of mk-801 on the lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in rats.;mk-801, a noncompetitive n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist, was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two seizure models, coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine and administration of a high dose of pilocarpine alone. three major results are reported. first, pretreatment with mk-801 produced an effective and dose-dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium-pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone, suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two models. second, the anticonvulsant effect of mk-801 in the lithium-pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activity. this observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that mk-801 binding requires agonist-induced opening of the channel sites of the nmda receptor. third, although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine, it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seizures. administration of mk-801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine, i.e., during status epilepticus, gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate. these results suggest that activation of nmda receptors plays an important role in status epilepticus and brain damage in the lithium-pilocarpine model. this was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of nmda and pilocarpine were synergistic, resulting in status epilepticus and subsequent mortality.;0;0;1;0

increased anxiogenic effects of caffeine in panic disorders.;the effects of oral administration of caffeine (10 mg/kg) on behavioral ratings, somatic symptoms, blood pressure and plasma levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol (mhpg) and cortisol were determined in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting dsm-iii criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder. caffeine produced significantly greater increases in subject-rated anxiety, nervousness, fear, nausea, palpitations, restlessness, and tremors in the patients compared with healthy subjects. in the patients, but not the healthy subjects, these symptoms were significantly correlated with plasma caffeine levels. seventy-one percent of the patients reported that the behavioral effects of caffeine were similar to those experienced during panic attacks. caffeine did not alter plasma mhpg levels in either the healthy subjects or patients. caffeine increased plasma cortisol levels equally in the patient and healthy groups. because caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these results suggest that some panic disorder patients may have abnormalities in neuronal systems involving adenosine. patients with anxiety disorders may benefit by avoiding caffeine-containing foods and beverages.;1;0;1;0

combined androgen blockade-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement.;background: to determine the onset and extent of combined androgen blockade (cab)-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement. patients and methods: forty-two patients with biopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [26 with stage c (t3n0m0) and 16 with stage d1 (t3n1m0)] were included in this study. all patients received cab [leuprolide acetate (lhrh-a) 3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide, tid, per os] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-cab). hb, psa and testosterone measurements were recorded. patients with stage d2-3 disease, abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study. the duration of the study was six months. results: the mean hemoglobin (hb) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14.2 g/dl to 14.0 g/dl, 13.5 g/dl, 13.2 g/dl and 12.7 g/dl at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-cab, respectively. severe and clinically evident anemia of hb < 11 g/dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients (14.3%). this cab-induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic. at six months post-cab, patients with severe anemia had a hb mean value of 10.2 +/- 0.1 g/dl (x +/- se), whereas the other patients had mild anemia with hb mean value of 13.2 +/- 0.17 (x +/- se). the development of severe anemia at 6 months post-cab was predictable by the reduction of hb baseline value of more than 2.5 g/dl after 3 months of cab (p = 0.01). the development of severe cab-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with t baseline values (t < 3 ng/ml versus t > or = 3 ng/ml), with age (< 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs), and clinical stage (stage c versus stage d1). severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections (3 times/week for 1 month) of recombinant erythropoietin (rhuepo-beta). conclusion: our data suggest that rhuepo-beta correctable cab-induced anemia occurs in 14.3% of prostate cancer patients after 6 months of therapy.;0;1;1;1

sodium bicarbonate alleviates penile pain induced by intracavernous injections for erectile dysfunction.;in an attempt to determine whether penile pain associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication, we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of penile pain following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the intracorporeal medications. a total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0.2 ml. of a combination of 3 drugs: 6 mg. papaverine, 100 micrograms. phentolamine and 10 micrograms. prostaglandin e1 with (ph 7.05) or without (ph 4.17) the addition of sodium bicarbonate (0.03 meq.). of the 19 patients without sodium bicarbonate added to the medication 11 (58%) complained of penile pain due to the medication, while only 1 of the 19 men (5%) who received sodium bicarbonate complained of penile pain. from these data we conclude that the penile pain following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication, which can be overcome by elevating the ph to a neutral level.;0;0;1;0

frequency of appearance of myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (mpo-anca) in graves' disease patients treated with propylthiouracil and the relationship between mpo-anca and clinical manifestations.;objective: myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (mpo-anca)-positive vasculitis has been reported in patients with graves' disease who were treated with propylthiouracil (ptu). the appearance of mpo-anca in these cases was suspected of being related to ptu because the titres of mpo-anca decreased when ptu was stopped. nevertheless, there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of mpo-anca and vasculitis during ptu therapy, or on the incidence of mpo-anca in untreated graves' disease patients. therefore, we sought to address these parameters in patients with graves' disease. patients: we investigated 102 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to graves' disease for the presence of mpo-anca, and for the development vasculitis after starting ptu therapy. twenty-nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of ptu or because the observation period was less than 3 months. the remaining 73 patients (55 women and 18 men), all of whom were examined for more than 3 months, were adopted as the subjects of the investigation. the median observation period was 23.6 months (range: 3-37 months). measurements: mpo-anca was measured at intervals of 2-6 months. results: before treatment, the mpo-anca titres of all 102 untreated graves' disease patients were within the reference range (below 10 u/ml). three (4.1%) of the 73 patients were positive for mpo-anca at 13, 16 and 17 months, respectively, after the start of ptu therapy. in two of them, the mpo-anca titres transiently increased to 12.8 and 15.0 u/ml, respectively, despite continued ptu therapy, but no vasculitic disorders developed. in the third patient, the mpo-anca titre increased to 204 u/ml and she developed a higher fever, oral ulcers and polyarthralgia, but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping ptu therapy, and the mpo-anca titre decreased to 20.7 u/ml by 4 months after discontinuing ptu. conclusions: ptu therapy may be related to the appearance of mpo-anca, but mpo-anca does not appear to be closely related to vasculitis.;0;0;1;0

treatment of compensatory gustatory hyperhidrosis with topical glycopyrrolate.;gustatory hyperhidrosis is facial sweating usually associated with the eating of hot spicy food or even smelling this food. current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs, the topical application of anticholinergics or aluminum chloride, and the injection of botulinum toxin. thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1.5% or 2% topical glycopyrrolate. all patients had gustatory hyperhidrosis, which interfered with their social activities, after transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy, and which was associated with compensatory focal hyperhidrosis. after applying topical glycopyrrolate, the subjective effect was excellent (no sweating after eating hot spicy food) in 10 patients (77%), and fair (clearly reduced sweating) in 3 patients (23%). all had reported incidents of being very embarrassed whilst eating hot spicy foods. adverse effects included a mildly dry mouth and a sore throat in 2 patients (2% glycopyrrolate), a light headache in 1 patient (1.5% glycopyrrolate). the topical application of a glycopyrrolate pad appeared to be safe, efficacious, well tolerated, and a convenient method of treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of gustatory hyperhidrosis in post transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy or sympathicotomy patients, with few side effects.;0;0;1;0

epileptogenic activity of folic acid after drug induces sle (folic acid and epilepsy);objective: to study the effect of folic acid-containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth defects and epilepsy-related side effects. study design: first a randomised trial, later periconception care including in total 12225 females. results: of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid (0.8 mg)-containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed epilepsy-related side effects during the periconception period. one epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate. another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin. this 22-year-old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic acid (1 mg)-containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation. she developed status epilepticus and later symptoms of systemic lupus erythematodes. her pregnancy ended with stillbirth. conclusions: the epileptic pregnant patient's autoimmune disease (probably drug-induced lupus) could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of folic acid triggered a cluster of seizures. physiological dose (<1 mg) of folic acid both in healthy and 60 epileptic women, all without any autoimmune disease, did not increase the risk for epileptic seizures.;0;1;1;0

gem-p chemotherapy is active in the treatment of relapsed hodgkin lymphoma.;"hodgkin lymphoma (hl) is a relatively chemosensitive malignancy. however, for those who relapse, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice which relies on adequate disease control with salvage chemotherapy. regimens commonly used often require inpatient administration and can be difficult to deliver due to toxicity. gemcitabine and cisplatin have activity in hl, non-overlapping toxicity with first-line chemotherapeutics, and may be delivered in an outpatient setting. in this retrospective single-centre analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory hl treated with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) day (d)1, d8 and d15; methylprednisolone 1,000 mg d1-5; and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) d15, every 28 days (gem-p) were included. demographic, survival, response and toxicity data were recorded. forty-one eligible patients were identified: median age 27. one hundred and twenty-two cycles of gem-p were administered in total (median 3 cycles; range 1-6). twenty of 41 (48 %) patients received gem-p as second-line treatment and 11/41 (27 %) as third-line therapy. overall response rate (orr) to gem-p in the entire cohort was 80 % (complete response (cr) 37 %, partial response 44 %) with 14/15 cr confirmed as a metabolic cr on pet and orr of 85 % in the 20 second-line patients. the most common grade 3/4 toxicities were haematological: neutropenia 54 % and thrombocytopenia 51 %. median follow-up from the start of gem-p was 4.5 years. following gem-p, 5-year progression-free survival was 46 % (95 % confidence interval (ci), 30-62 %) and 5-year overall survival was 59 % (95 % ci, 43-74 %). fourteen of 41 patients proceeded directly to autologous transplant. gem-p is a salvage chemotherapy with relatively high response rates, leading to successful transplantation in appropriate patients, in the treatment of relapsed or refractory hl.";0;1;0;1

phlorizin-induced glycosuria does not prevent gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats.;"because rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (dm) have a high solute diuresis (glycosuria of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to gentamicin-induced acute renal failure (arf). the protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity was studied in non-diabetic rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular glucose reabsorption with phlorizin (p). dm rats with mild glycosuria (similar in degree to that of the p treated animals) were also studied. unanesthetized adult female, sprague-dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days. group 1 (p alone) received p, 360 mg/day, for 15 days; group ii (p + gentamicin); group iii (gentamicin alone) and group iv (mild dm + gentamicin). nephrotoxic doses (40 mg/kg body wt/day) of gentamicin were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups ii to iv. in group i, p induced a moderate and stable glycosuria (3.9 +/- 0.1 g/day, se), and no functional or morphologic evidence of renal dysfunction (baseline ccr 2.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min, undetectable lysozymuria) or damage (tubular necrosis score [maximum 4], zero). in group ii, p did not prevent gentamicin-arf (maximal decrease in ccr at day 9.89%, p less than 0.001; peak lysozymuria, 1863 +/- 321 micrograms/day; and tubular necrosis score, 3.9 +/- 0.1). these values were not different from those of group iii: maximal decrease in ccr 73% (p less than 0.001); lysozymuria, 2147 +/- 701 micrograms/day; tubular necrosis score, 3.8 +/- 0.1.(abstract truncated at 250 words)";0;1;1;0

common brca1 variants and susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer in the general population.;most multiple case families of young onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer are thought to be due to highly penetrant mutations in the predisposing genes brca1 and brca2 . however , these mutations are uncommon in the population and they probably account for only a few percent of all breast cancer incidence . a much larger fraction of breast cancer might , in principle , be due to common variants which confer more modest individual risks . there are several common polymorphisms in the brca1 gene which generate amino acid substitutions . we have examined the frequency of four of these polymorphisms  gln356arg , pro871leu , glu1038gly and ser1613gly in large series of breast and ovarian cancer cases and matched controls . due to strong linkage disequilibrium , these four sites generate only three haplotypes with a frequency > 1 . 3 % . the most common haplotypes , defined by the alleles gln356pro871glu1038ser1613 and gln356leu871gly1038gly1613 , have frequencies of 0 . 57 and 0 . 32 respectively , and these frequencies do not differ significantly between patient and control groups . thus the most common polymorphisms of the brca1 gene do not make a significant contribution to breast or ovarian cancer risk . however , our data suggest that the arg356 allele may have a different genotype distribution in breast cancer patients from that in controls ( arg356 homozygotes are more frequent in the control groups , p = 0 . 01 ) , indicating that it may be protective against breast cancer . if this finding can be confirmed , it may provide an insight into the structural features of the brca1 protein that are important for its function .;0;0;1;1

hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy.;hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (nsaid) such as indomethacin. several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac, owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis. we describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 meq/l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration. in all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac. as no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause-and-effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia. these observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other nsaid are probably not justified.;0;1;0;0

effect of vincristine sulfate on pseudomonas infections in monkeys.;"in rhesus monkeys, intravenous challenge with 0.6 x 10(10) to 2.2 x 10(10)pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms caused acute illness of 4 to 5 days' duration with spontaneous recovery in 13 of 15 monkeys; blood cultures became negative 3 to 17 days after challenge. leukocytosis was observed in all monkeys. intravenous or intratracheal inoculation of 2.0 to 2.5 mg of vincristine sulfate was followed by leukopenia in 4 to 5 days. intravenous inoculation of 4.2 x 10(10) to 7.8 x 10(10) pyocin type 6 pseudomonas organisms in monkeys given vincristine sulfate 4 days previously resulted in fatal infection in 11 of 14 monkeys, whereas none of four receiving pseudomonas alone died. these studies suggest that an antimetabolite-induced leukopenia predisposes to severe pseudomonas sepsis and that such monkeys may serve as a biological model for study of comparative efficacy of antimicrobial agents.";0;0;1;0
the safety and efficacy of combination n-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (sc-48334) and zidovudine in patients with hiv-1 infection and 200-500 cd4 cells/mm3.;we conducted a double-blind, randomized phase ii study to evaluate the safety and activity of combination therapy with n-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (sc-48334) (an alpha-glucosidase i inhibitor) and zidovudine versus zidovudine alone. patients with 200 to 500 cd4 cells/mm3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior zidovudine therapy received sc-48334 (1000 mg every 8 h) and zidovudine (100 mg every 8 h) or zidovudine and placebo. sixty patients received combination therapy and 58, zidovudine and placebo. twenty-three patients (38%) and 15 (26%), in the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively, discontinued therapy (p = 0.15). the mean sc-48334 steady-state trough level (4.04 +/- 0.99 micrograms/ml) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). the mean increase in cd4 cells at week 4 was 73.8 cells/mm3 and 52.4 cells/mm3 for the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively (p > 0.36). for patients with prior zidovudine therapy, the mean change in cd4 cells in the combination and zidovudine groups was 63.7 cells/mm3 and 4.9 cells/mm3 at week 8 and 6.8 cells/mm3 and -45.1 cells/mm3 at week 16, respectively. the number of patients with suppression of hiv p24 antigenemia in the combination and zidovudine groups was six (40%) and two (11%) at week 4 (p = 0.10) and five (45%) and two (14%) at week 24 (p = 0.08), respectively. diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, and weight loss were common for combination recipients.(abstract truncated at 250 words);0;0;1;0

efficacy and safety of granisetron, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist, in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by high-dose cisplatin.;"purpose: to assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of granisetron (kytril; smithkline beecham pharmaceuticals, philadelphia, pa) when administered as a single intravenous (iv) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. patients and methods: one hundred eighty-four chemotherapy-naive patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (81 to 120 mg/m2) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses (5, 10, 20, or 40 micrograms/kg) administered before chemotherapy. patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours, and vital signs, nausea, vomiting, retching, and appetite were assessed. safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes. results: after granisetron doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 micrograms/kg, a major response (< or = two vomiting or retching episodes, and no antiemetic rescue) was recorded in 23%, 57%, 58%, and 60% of patients, respectively, and a complete response (no vomiting or retching, and no antiemetic rescue) in 18%, 41%, 40%, and 47% of patients, respectively. there was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea (p = .0015) and vomiting (p = .0001), and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10-micrograms/kg dosing groups than in the 5-micrograms/kg dosing group. as granisetron dose increased, appetite return increased (p = .040). headache was the most frequently reported adverse event (20%). conclusion: a single 10-, 20-, or 40-micrograms/kg dose of granisetron was effective in controlling vomiting in 57% to 60% of patients who received cisplatin at doses greater than 81 mg/m2 and totally prevented vomiting in 40% to 47% of patients. there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between the 10-micrograms/kg dose and the 20- and 40-micrograms/kg doses. granisetron was well tolerated at all doses.";0;0;1;0

blood pressure response to chronic low-dose intrarenal noradrenaline infusion in conscious rats.;sodium chloride solution (0.9%) or noradrenaline in doses of 4, 12 and 36 micrograms h-1 kg-1 was infused for five consecutive days, either intrarenally (by a new technique) or intravenously into rats with one kidney removed. intrarenal infusion of noradrenaline caused hypertension at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously. intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused higher plasma noradrenaline concentrations and a shift of the plasma noradrenaline concentration-blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma noradrenaline levels. these results suggest that hypertension after chronic intrarenal noradrenaline infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating noradrenaline and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism.;1;1;1;0
cancer incidence and metolachlor use in the agricultural health study: an update.;unassigned: metolachlor, a widely used herbicide, is classified as a group c carcinogen by the u.s. environmental protection agency based on increased liver neoplasms in female rats. epidemiologic studies of the health effects of metolachlor have been limited. the agricultural health study (ahs) is a prospective cohort study including licensed private and commercial pesticide applicators in iowa and north carolina enrolled 1993-1997. we evaluated cancer incidence through 2010/2011 (nc/ia) for 49,616 applicators, 53% of whom reported ever using metolachlor. we used poisson regression to evaluate relations between two metrics of metolachlor use (lifetime days, intensity-weighted lifetime days) and cancer incidence. we saw no association between metolachlor use and incidence of all cancers combined (n = 5,701 with a 5-year lag) or most site-specific cancers. for liver cancer, in analyses restricted to exposed workers, elevations observed at higher categories of use were not statistically significant. however, trends for both lifetime and intensity-weighted lifetime days of metolachor use were positive and statistically significant with an unexposed reference group. a similar pattern was observed for follicular cell lymphoma, but no other lymphoma subtypes. an earlier suggestion of increased lung cancer risk at high levels of metolachlor use in this cohort was not confirmed in this update. this suggestion of an association between metolachlor and liver cancer among pesticide applicators is a novel finding and echoes observation of increased liver neoplasms in some animal studies. however, our findings for both liver cancer and follicular cell lymphoma warrant follow-up to better differentiate effects of metolachlor use from other factors.;0;1;1;1

attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride in rats.;the effect of amiloride on lithium-induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with licl. amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute (6 or 12 h) and a subacute (3 days) experiment. 6 h after the administration of amiloride, a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied. at 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels. after 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake. in all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level. it is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium-treated patients suffering from polydipsia and polyuria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated lithium levels and might be hazardous.;0;1;1;0

frequent detection of codon 877 mutation in the androgen receptor gene in advanced prostate cancers.;prostatic tissue specimens derived from transurethral resections of patients with metastatic prostate cancer were analyzed for genetic alterations in the hormone-binding domain of the androgen receptor ( ar ) gene . direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-derived dnas of 6 of 24 specimens revealed a codon 877 mutation ( act-- > gct , thr-- > ala ) in the hormone-binding domain of the ar gene . this same ar mutation has been reported previously in a metastatic prostate cancer cell line , lncap , where this mutation confers upon the ar an altered ligand-binding specificity which is stimulated by estrogens , progestagens , and antiandrogens . it is possible that analogous to an activated / altered growth factor receptor oncogene , codon 877 mutant ar with altered ligand binding may provide a selective growth advantage in the genesis of a subset of advanced prostate cancer . although estrogens are used infrequently , antiandrogens are used increasingly in hormonal therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer . the stimulatory effect of these therapeutic agents on the codon 877 mutant ar further suggests that this frequently observed ar mutation may contribute to the treatment refractory disease . .;0;0;0;1
cholecystokinin-octapeptide restored morphine-induced hippocampal long-term potentiation impairment in rats.;cholecystokinin-octapeptide (cck-8), which is a typical brain-gut peptide, exerts a wide range of biological activities on the central nervous system. we have previously reported that cck-8 significantly alleviated morphine-induced amnesia and reversed spine density decreases in the ca1 region of the hippocampus in morphine-treated animals. here, we investigated the effects of cck-8 on long-term potentiation (ltp) in the lateral perforant path (lpp)-granule cell synapse of rat dentate gyrus (dg) in acute saline or morphine-treated rats. population spikes (ps), which were evoked by stimulation of the lpp, were recorded in the dg region. acute morphine (30mg/kg, s.c.) treatment significantly attenuated hippocampal ltp and cck-8 (1ug, i.c.v.) restored the amplitude of ps that was attenuated by morphine injection. furthermore, microinjection of cck-8 (0.1 and 1ug, i.c.v.) also significantly augmented hippocampal ltp in saline-treated (1ml/kg, s.c.) rats. pre-treatment of the cck2 receptor antagonist l-365,260 (10ug, i.c.v) reversed the effects of cck-8, but the cck1 receptor antagonist l-364,718 (10ug, i.c.v) did not. the present results demonstrate that cck-8 attenuates the effect of morphine on hippocampal ltp through cck2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of cck-8 on morphine-induced memory impairment.;0;0;1;0
topiramate-induced nephrolithiasis.;topiramate is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating refractory seizures. urologists should be aware that this medication can cause metabolic acidosis in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. in addition, a distal tubular acidification defect may result, thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine ph. these factors can lead to the development of calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis. we report the first two cases of topiramate-induced nephrolithiasis in the urologic literature.;0;1;1;0

severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas.;background: glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood. with current treatment regimens including combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year. therefore, patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen. generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin, whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known. however, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin, which is infrequently reported. case: a 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe. he complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection. various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen. results: he was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection. although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished, inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks. finally, 6 weeks later, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost. conclusion: when performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin, we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity. it is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects.;0;0;1;1
recovery of tacrolimus-associated brachial neuritis after conversion to everolimus in a pediatric renal transplant recipient--case report and review of the literature.;tac has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for solid organ transplantation in pediatrics. neurotoxicity is a potentially serious toxic effect. it is characterized by encephalopathy, headaches, seizures, or neurological deficits. here, we describe an eight-and-a-half-yr-old male renal transplant recipient with right bn. mri demonstrated hyperintense t2 signals in the cervical cord and right brachial plexus roots indicative of both myelitis and right brachial plexitis. symptoms persisted for three months despite tac dose reduction, administration of ivig and four doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy. improvement and eventually full recovery only occurred after tac was completely discontinued and successfully replaced by everolimus.;0;1;1;0

over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen-induced rat pituitary tumors may mediate estrogen-initiated tumor angiogenesis.;estrogens, which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers, can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of fischer 344 rats. the mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction, during estrogen carcinogenesis, are still unknown. to elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor viii related antigen (fviiirag) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (vegf/vpf) was examined by western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. the expression of vegf receptor (vegfr-2/flk-1/kdr) was also examined by immunohistochemistry. the results demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol (e2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. the high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated vegf/vpf protein expression in the e2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (ovex) rats. vegf/vpf and fviiirag immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin (uea1) binding studies, indicate that the elevation of vegf protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non-endothelial cells. after 15 days of e2 exposure, vegf/vpf protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. the function of non-endothelial-derived vegf is not clear. furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that vegfr-2 (flk-1/kdr), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of e2 exposure. these findings suggest that over expression of vegf and its receptor (vegfr-2) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of estrogen induced tumor angiogenesis in the rat pituitary.;0;0;0;1
haplotype and multipoint linkage analysis in finnish choroideremia families.;multipoint linkage analysis of choroideremia ( tcd ) and seven x chromosomal restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( rflps ) was carried out in 18 finnish tcd families . the data place tcd distal to pgk and dxs72 , very close to dxys1 and dxys5 ( zmax = 24 at theta = 0 ) and proximal to dxys4 and dxys12 . this agrees with the data obtained from other linkage studies and from physical mapping . all the tcd males and carrier females studied have the same dxys1 allele in coupling with tcd . in northeastern finland , 66 / 69 chromosomes carrying tcd had the same haplotype at loci dxs72 , dxys1 , dxys4 , and dxys12 . the same haplotype is seen in only 15 / 99 chromosomes not carrying tcd . moreover , in 71 / 104 non-tcd chromosomes , the haplotype at six marker loci is different from those seen in any of the 76 tcd chromosomes . this supports the previously described hypothesis that the large northern finnish choroideremia pedigrees , comprising a total of over 80 living patients representing more than a fifth of all tcd patients described worldwide , carry the same mutation . these linkage and haplotype data provide improved opportunities for prenatal diagnosis based on rflp studies . .;0;0;1;0
targeted modification of the apolipoprotein b gene results in hypobetalipoproteinemia and developmental abnormalities in mice.;familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal codominant disorder resulting in a dramatic reduction in plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein ( apo ) b , cholesterol , and beta-migrating lipoproteins . a benefit of hypobetalipoproteinemia is that mildly affected individuals may be protected from coronary vascular disease . we have used gene targeting to generate mice with a modified apob allele . mice containing this allele display all of the hallmarks of human hypobetalipoproteinemia  they produce a truncated apob protein , apob70 , and have markedly decreased plasma concentrations of apob , beta-lipoproteins , and total cholesterol . in addition , the mice manifest several characteristics that are occasionally observed in human hypobetalipoproteinemia , including reduced plasma triglyceride concentrations , fasting chylomicronemia , and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol . an unexpected finding is that the modified apob allele is strongly associated with exencephalus and hydrocephalus . these mice should help increase our understanding of hypobetalipoproteinemia , atherogenesis , and the etiology of exencephalus and hydrocephalus . .;1;0;0;0
relative efficacy and toxicity of netilmicin and tobramycin in oncology patients.;we prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with piperacillin sodium in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections. the two treatment regimens were equally efficacious. nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin (17% vs 11%). ototoxicity occurred in four (9.5%) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 (22%) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and piperacillin-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients. the number of greater than or equal to 15-db increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-db changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin- vs tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115). we conclude that aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with netilmicin than with tobramycin.;0;1;1;0
insulin gene region contributes to genetic susceptibility to, but may not to low incidence of, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in japanese.;in the caucasian population , it has been demonstrated that the insulin gene ( ins ) region contains the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus locus ( iddm2 ) . in the japanese population , however , there has been no report demonstrating the contribution of iddm2 to the pathogenesis of iddm . we conducted an association study of iddm in a large number of japanese subjects with multiple polymorphisms in ins region . we found a significant association of the ins region with iddm . alleles positively associated with iddm in ins region were the same as those positively-associated with iddm in caucasian population , although positively-associated alleles are very common ( allele frequencies > 0 . 9 ) in the japanese general population . these data suggest that iddm2 is involved in the genetic susceptibility to iddm in japanese . the high frequencies of disease-associated alleles in the general population suggest that iddm2 locus is not responsible for the low incidence of iddm in japanese .;0;0;1;0
rhabdomyolysis and brain ischemic stroke in a heroin-dependent male under methadone maintenance therapy.;objective: there are several complications associated with heroin abuse, some of which are life-threatening. methadone may aggravate this problem. method: a clinical case description. results: a 33-year-old man presented with rhabdomyolysis and cerebral ischemic stroke after intravenous heroin. he had used heroin since age 20, and had used 150 mg methadone daily for 6 months. he was found unconsciousness at home and was sent to our hospital. in the er, his opiate level was 4497 ng/ml. in the icu, we found rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and acute respiratory failure. after transfer to an internal ward, we noted aphasia and weakness of his left limbs. after mri, we found cerebral ischemic infarction. conclusion: those using methadone and heroin simultaneously may increase risk of rhabdomyolysis and ischemic stroke. patients under methadone maintenance therapy should be warned regarding these serious adverse events. hypotheses of heroin-related rhabdomyolysis and stroke in heroin abusers are discussed.;0;1;1;0

changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and hepatoma of mice induced by alpha-benzene hexachloride.;peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha-benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically. although most of the hepatomas were well-differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes, the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes. at the 16th week of carcinogen feeding, hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages. a majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes. within the nodules, foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared. these cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed. no abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats.;0;1;0;1
a single origin of phenylketonuria in yemenite jews.;phenylketonuria ( pku ) is a metabolic disease caused by recessive mutations of the gene encoding the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) . the incidence of pku varies widely across different geographic areas , and is highest ( about 1 in 5 , 000 live births ) in ireland and western scotland , and among yemenite jews . a limited number of point mutations account for most of the pku cases in the european population . here we report that a single molecular defect--a deletion spanning the third exon of the pah gene--is responsible for all the pku cases among the yemenite jews . examination of a random sample of yemenite jews using a molecular probe that detects the carriers of this deletion indicated a high frequency of the defective gene in this community . although the deleted pah gene was traced to 25 different locations throughout yemen , family histories and official documents of the yemenite jewish community showed that the common ancestor of all the carriers of this genetic defect lived in sana , the capital of yemen , before the eighteenth century . .;0;1;0;0
somatic rearrangement of chromosome 14 in human lymphocytes.;ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder associated with immune deficiency , chromosome instability , and a predisposition to lymphoid malignancy . we have detected chromosomally anomalous clones of lymphocytes in eight patients with this disorder . chromosome banding disclosed that the clones are consistently marked by structural rearrangement of the long arm ( q ) of chromosome 14 . a translocation involving 14q was found in clones obtained from seven of the eight patients whereas a ring 14 chromosome was found in a clone obtained from the other . these findings as well as data obtained by others for patients with ataxia-telangiectasia suggest that structural rearrangement of 14q is the initial chromosomal change in lymphocyte clones of patients with this disorder . chromosomes of lymphocytes from one of the patients were studied before and after the onset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia . before leukemia was diagnosed , the patient had a lymphocyte clone with a 14q translocation . this clone appears to have given rise to the leukemic cells . we hypothesize that structural rearrangement of 14q is directly related to abnormal growth of lymphocytes and that it may be a step toward the development of lymphoid malignancies . increasing evidence , provided by others , for the nonrandom involvement of 14q in african-type burkitts lymphoma and other lymphoid neoplasms further strengthens this hypothesis . .;0;0;1;1

molecular basis of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency causing cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood.;"beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids provides the major source of energy in the heart . defects in enzymes of the beta-oxidation pathway cause sudden , unexplained death in childhood , acute hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure , skeletal myopathy , and cardiomyopathy . very-long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase [ vlcad ; very-long-chain-acyl-coa  ( acceptor ) 2 , 3-oxidoreductase , ec 1 . 3 3 . 99 99 . 13 ] catalyzes the first step in beta-oxidation . we have isolated the human vlcad cdna and gene and determined the complete nucleotide sequences . polymerase chain reaction amplification of vlcad mrna and genomic exons defined the molecular defects in two patients with vlcad deficiency who presented with unexplained cardiac arrest and cardiomyopathy . in one , a homozygous mutation in the consensus dinucleotide of the donor splice site ( g + 1-- > a ) was associated with universal skipping of the prior exon ( exon 11 ) . the second patient was a compound heterozygote , with a missense mutation , c1837-- > t , changing the arginine at residue 613 to tryptophan on one allele and a single base deletion at the intron-exon 6 boundary as the second mutation . this initial delineation of human mutations in vlcad suggests that vlcad deficiency reduces myocardial fatty acid beta-oxidation and energy production and is associated with cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood .";1;1;0;0

proliferation-related expression of p19/nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase.;"high level expression of the nm23-h1 gene , which encodes for a nucleoside diphosphate kinase , has been found to correlate with diminished metastasis in some tumors but not in others . we have previously identified the protein product of the nm23-h1 gene in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels and have designated it p19 / nm23 . in neuroblastoma , higher levels of p19 / nm23 , which are associated with amplification of the n-myc oncogene , large tumor mass , and metastasis , were observed in advanced stage tumors compared with limited stage disease . because of the variable expression of nm23-h1 in different tumors , we have investigated the relationship between amounts of the protein and cell proliferation . the levels of p19 / nm23 were compared between resting and mitotically stimulated normal human pbls and in leukemia cells . the amount of p19 / nm23 increased in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation and paralleled the increase in dna synthesis . in leukemia cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia , p19 / nm23 levels were also increased relative to resting normal lymphocytes . treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin , which inhibits proliferation , blocked the increase in p19 / nm23 ; treatment of the leukemia cell line hl-60 with dimethylsulfoxide , which induces terminal differentiation , resulted in diminished levels of p19 / nm23 . our data therefore provide evidence that nm23-h1 expression is related to cell proliferative activity . .";0;0;1;1

the flavonoid apigenin delays forgetting of passive avoidance conditioning in rats.;the present experiments were performed to study the effect of the flavonoid apigenin (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), 1 h before acquisition), on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step-through passive avoidance task, in young male wistar rats. there were no differences between saline- and apigenin-treated groups in the 24 h retention trial. furthermore, apigenin did not prevent the amnesia induced by scopolamine (1mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the acquisition). the saline- and apigenin-treated rats that did not step through into the dark compartment during the cut-off time (540 s) were retested weekly for up to eight weeks. in the saline treated group, the first significant decline in passive avoidance response was observed at four weeks, and complete memory loss was found five weeks after the acquisition of the passive avoidance task. at the end of the experimental period, 60% of the animals treated with apigenin still did not step through. these data suggest that 1) apigenin delays the long-term forgetting but did not modulate the 24 h retention of fear memory and 2) the obtained beneficial effect of apigenin on the passive avoidance conditioning is mediated by mechanisms that do not implicate its action on the muscarinic cholinergic system.;0;0;1;0

nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin a and fk506: inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase.;"cyclosporin a (csa; 50 mg/kg) and fujimycine (fk506; 5 mg/kg), but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male wistar rats when given for 10 days. the molecular mechanisms of csa and fk506 toxicity were investigated. cyclophilin a and fk506-binding protein, the main intracytoplasmic receptors for csa and fk506, respectively, were each detected in renal tissue extract. in the kidney, high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants csa and fk506, but not by rapamycin. finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of csa and fk506, but not rapamycin. these results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of csa and fk506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.";0;1;1;0
pentoxifylline (trental) does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia: implications for dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial imaging.;dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular disease. many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline (trental), a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent claudication. whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is unknown. therefore, we studied the hyperemic response to dipyridamole in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline (0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg i.v.) or theophylline (3 mg/kg i.v.). baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups. dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm/kg i.v. pentoxifylline (p less than 0.002). neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline (p less than 0.01). we conclude that pentoxyifylline does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses.;1;0;0;0
international mexiletine and placebo antiarrhythmic coronary trial: i. report on arrhythmia and other findings. impact research group.;"the antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of mexiletine (mexitil-perlongets) were evaluated in a double-blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented myocardial infarction. the primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording. large differences, regarded as statistically significant, between the mexiletine and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4, but only trends were observed at month 12. these differences were observed even though the serum mexiletine levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the drug. there were more deaths in the mexiletine group (7.6%) than in the placebo group (4.8%); the difference was not statistically significant. the incidence of coronary events was similar in both groups. previously recognized side effects, particularly tremor and gastrointestinal problems, were more frequent in the mexiletine group than in the placebo group.";1;0;1;0
assessment of cardiomyocyte dna synthesis during hypertrophy in adult mice.;the ability of cardiomyocytes to synthesize dna in response to experimentally induced cardiac hypertrophy was assessed in adult mice. isoproterenol delivered by osmotic minipump implantation in adult c3heb/fej mice resulted in a 46% increase in heart weight and a 19.3% increase in cardiomyocyte area. no dna synthesis, as assessed by autoradiographic analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes, was observed in control or hypertrophic hearts. a survey of 15 independent inbred strains of mice revealed that ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclear number ranged from 3 to 13% mononucleate, suggesting that cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation is influenced directly or indirectly by genetic background. to determine whether the capacity for reactive dna synthesis was also subject to genetic regulation, cardiac hypertrophy was induced in the strains of mice comprising the extremes of the nuclear number survey. these data indicate that adult mouse atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes do not synthesize dna in response to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.;1;1;0;0
persistent sterile leukocyturia is associated with impaired renal function in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children treated with indinavir.;background: prolonged administration of indinavir is associated with the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults. these well-documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children. design: a prospective study to monitor indinavir-related nephrotoxicity in a cohort of 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children treated with indinavir. methods: urinary ph, albumin, creatinine, the presence of erythrocytes, leukocytes, bacteria and crystals, and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks. serum creatinine levels were routinely determined at the same time points. steady-state pharmacokinetics of indinavir were done at week 4 after the initiation of indinavir. results: the cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia (> or =75 cells/ micro l in at least 2 consecutive visits) after 96 weeks was 53%. persistent sterile leukocyturia was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin/creatinine ratio and by microscopic hematuria. the cumulative incidence of serum creatinine levels >50% above normal was 33% after 96 weeks. children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had serum creatinine levels of 50% above normal than those children without persistent sterile leukocyturia. in children younger than 5.6 years, persistent sterile leukocyturia was significantly more frequent than in older children. a higher cumulative incidence of persistent leukocyturia was found in children with an area under the curve >19 mg/l x h or a peak serum level of indinavir >12 mg/l. in 4 children, indinavir was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity. subsequently, the serum creatinine levels decreased, the urine albumin/creatinine ratios returned to zero, and the leukocyturia disappeared within 3 months. conclusions: children treated with indinavir have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia. children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had an increase in serum creatinine levels of >50% above normal. younger children have an additional risk for renal complications. the impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis. indinavir-associated nephrotoxicity must be monitored closely, especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile leukocyturia, age <5.6 years, an area under the curve of indinavir >19 mg/l x h, and a c(max) >12 mg/l.;0;1;1;0

dose-related beneficial and adverse effects of dietary corticosterone on organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy in chickens.;tri-ortho-tolyl phosphate (totp), 360 mg/kg, po, and 0,0'-diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (dfp), 1 mg/kg sc, were administered to adult white leghorn chickens 24 hr after they were placed on diets containing 0 to 300 ppm corticosterone. supplemented diets were continued until clinical signs and lesions of delayed neuropathy appeared. although low concentrations (less than or equal to 50 ppm) of corticosterone had beneficial effects on totp-induced neuropathy, greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either totp or dfp. neurotoxic esterase activities 24 hr after totp or dfp were less than 20% of values measured in chickens not given organophosphorous compounds. chickens given 200 ppm corticosterone without totp or dfp had significantly elevated activity of plasma cholinesterase and significantly inhibited activity of liver carboxylesterase. degenerating myelinated fibers were also evident in distal levels of the peripheral nerves of chickens given totp or dfp.;0;1;1;0

combined antiretroviral therapy causes cardiomyopathy and elevates plasma lactate in transgenic aids mice.;"highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) is implicated in cardiomyopathy (cm) and in elevated plasma lactate (la) in aids through mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction. to determine mitochondrial events from haart in vivo, 8-week-old hemizygous transgenic aids mice (nl4-3delta gag/pol; tg) and wild-type fvb/n littermates were treated with the haart combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days. at termination of the experiments, mice underwent echocardiography, quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of cm (ventricular mrna encoding atrial natriuretic factor [anf] and sarcoplasmic calcium atpase [serca2]), and determination of plasma la. myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. after 35 days in the tg + haart cohort, left ventricular mass increased 160% by echocardiography. molecularly, anf mrna increased 250% and serca2 mrna decreased 57%. biochemically, la was elevated (8.5 +/- 2.0 mm). pathologically, granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes, indicating enlarged, damaged mitochondria. findings were confirmed ultrastructurally. no changes were found in other cohorts. after 10 days, only anf was elevated, and only in the tg + haart cohort. results show that cumulative haart caused mitochondrial cm with elevated la in aids transgenic mice.";1;0;1;0
hypotension as a manifestation of cardiotoxicity in three patients receiving cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.;cardiac symptoms, including hypotension, developed in three patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma while being treated with cisplatin (cddp) and 5-fluorouracil (5-fu). in two patients, hypotension was associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction. all three patients required therapy discontinuation. cardiac enzymes remained normal despite transient electrocardiographic (ekg) changes. the presentation and cardiac evaluation (hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and scintigraphic) of these patients suggest new manifestations of 5-fu cardiotoxicity that may be influenced by cddp. the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed.;1;0;1;1

a phase i/ii study of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as first-line therapy for head and neck cancers: preliminary results.;"improved outcomes among patients with head and neck carcinomas require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy. preliminary results of an eastern cooperative oncology group study of single-agent paclitaxel (taxol; bristol-myers squibb company, princeton, nj) reported a 37% response rate in patients with head and neck cancer, and the paclitaxel/cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients. we initiated a phase i/ii trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed-dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma. to date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial. primary tumor sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each. of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity, four had stage iii and 16 had stage iv disease. treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2). the dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits. at the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable. with paclitaxel doses of 200 mg/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d is given (days 4 through 12). of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response. three patients had no change and disease progressed in two. the overall response rate is 72%. eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy. two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses. alopecia, paresthesias, and arthralgias/myalgias have occurred frequently, but with one exception (a grade 3 myalgia) they have been grade 1 or 2. no dose-limiting hematologic toxicity has been seen. paclitaxel/cisplatin is an effective first-line regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and continued study is warranted. results thus far suggest no dose-response effect for paclitaxel doses above 200 mg/m2.";0;0;1;1

electron microscopic investigations of the cyclophosphamide-induced lesions of the urinary bladder of the rat and their prevention by mesna.;fully developed cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis is characterized by nearly complete detachment of the urothelium, severe submucosal edema owing to damage to the microvascular bed and focal muscle necroses. the initial response to the primary attack by the cyclophosphamide metabolites seems to be fragmentation of the luminal membrane. this damages the cellular barrier against the hypertonic urine. subsequent breaks in the lateral cell membranes of the superficial cells and in all the plasma membranes of the intermediate and basal cells, intercellular and intracellular edema and disintegration of the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes lead to progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells with exposure and splitting of the basal membrane. the morphological changes of the endothelial cells, which become more pronounced in the later stages of the experiment, the involvement of blood vessels regardless of their diameter and the location-dependent extent of the damage indicate a direct type of damage which is preceded by a mediator-induced increase in permeability, the morphological correlate of which is the formation of gaps in the interendothelial cell connections on the venules. these changes can be effectively prevented by mesna. the only sign of a possible involvement is the increase in the number of specific granules with a presumed lysosomal function in the superficial cells.;0;0;1;0
a point mutation thr(799)met on the alpha(2) integrin leads to the formation of new human platelet alloantigen sit(a) and affects collagen-induced aggregation.;a new platelet-specific alloantigen , termed sit ( a ) , was identified in a severe case of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia . the sit ( a ) alloantigen is of low frequency ( 1 / 400 ) in the german population . immunochemical studies demonstrated that the sit ( a ) epitopes reside on platelet glycoprotein ( gp ) ia . nucleotide sequence analysis of gpia cdna derived from sit ( a ) -positive platelets showed c ( 2531 ) -- > t ( 2531 ) point mutation , resulting in thr ( 799 ) met dimorphism . analysis of genomic dna from 22 sit ( a ) -negative normal individuals showed that the thr ( 799 ) is encoded by acg ( 2532 ) ( 90 . 9 % ) or aca ( 2532 ) ( 9 . 1 % ) . to establish a dna typing technique , we elucidated the organization of the gpia gene adjacent to the polymorphic bases . the introns ( 421 bp and 1 . 2 kb ) encompass a 142-bp exon with the 2 polymorphic bases 2531 and 2532 . polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on dna derived from 100 donors using the restriction enzyme mae iii showed that the met ( 799 ) form of gpia is restricted to sit ( a ) ( + ) phenotype . analysis of stable chinese hamster ovary transfectants expressing allele-specific recombinant forms of gpia showed that anti-sit ( a ) exclusively reacted with the glu ( 505 ) met ( 799 ) , but not with the glu ( 505 ) thr ( 799 ) and the lys ( 505 ) thr ( 799 ) isoforms . in contrast , anti-br ( a ) ( hpa-5b ) only recognized the lys ( 505 ) thr ( 799 ) form , whereas anti-br ( b ) ( hpa-5a ) reacted with both glu ( 505 ) thr ( 799 ) and glu ( 505 ) met ( 799 ) isoforms . these results demonstrated that the met ( 799 ) is responsible for formation of the sit ( a ) alloantigenic determinants , whereas amino acid 505 ( lys or glu ) specifically controls the expression of br ( a ) and br ( b ) epitopes , respectively . platelet aggregation responses of sit ( a ) ( + ) individuals were diminished in response to collagen , indicating that the thr ( 799 ) met mutation affects the function of the gpia / iia complex;0;0;1;0

attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent corticosterone treatment in rats.;the development of schizophrenia may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events, in combination leading to overt disease. we investigated the effect of an early stress, in the form of maternal deprivation, combined with a later stress, simulated by chronic periadolescent corticosterone treatment, on behaviour in rats. acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of prepulse inhibition (ppi) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or corticosterone treatment, but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress. amphetamine treatment significantly disrupted ppi in both non-deprived groups, but was absent in both maternally deprived groups. the serotonin-1a receptor agonist, 8-oh-dpat, induced a significant disruption of ppi in all groups. amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in all groups. these results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress, caused by maternal deprivation, combined with 'adolescent' stress, simulated by corticosterone treatment, on dopaminergic regulation of ppi. the altered effects of apomorphine and amphetamine could indicate differential changes in dopamine receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation, or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus.;0;0;1;0
delirium during fluoxetine treatment. a case report.;the correlation between high serum tricyclic antidepressant concentrations and central nervous system side effects has been well established. only a few reports exist, however, on the relationship between the serum concentrations of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and their toxic effects. in some cases, a high serum concentration of citalopram (> 600 nmol/l) in elderly patients has been associated with increased somnolence and movement difficulties. widespread cognitive disorders, such as delirium, have not been previously linked with high blood levels of ssris. in this report, we describe a patient with acute hyperkinetic delirium connected with a high serum total fluoxetine (fluoxetine plus desmethylfluoxetine) concentration.;0;0;1;0
omitting fentanyl reduces nausea and vomiting, without increasing pain, after sevoflurane for day surgery.;background and objective: despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently. fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. methods: this double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl. results: omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% (p = 0.013). antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (p = 0.0012). dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting. combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (p = 0.049 and p = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (p = 0.034). pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl. fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane-sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia. conclusion: as fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery.;1;0;0;0

proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia.;l-dopa-induced dyskinesia (lid) is among the motor complications that arise in parkinson's disease (pd) patients after a prolonged treatment with l-dopa. to this day, transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of lid [neurobiol. dis., 17 (2004), 219] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking. in the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion rat model of pd treated with saline, l-dopa or bromocriptine using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (ms). rats treated with l-dopa were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of lid. among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight ms, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and hplc coupled tandem ms (lc/ms/ms). out of these 67 proteins, lid significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit. complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach. in conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in lid.;0;0;1;0

elevation of adam10, adam17, mmp-2 and mmp-9 expression with media degeneration features cacl2-induced thoracic aortic aneurysm in a rat model.;purpose: this study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm (taa) by calcium chloride (cacl(2))-induced arterial injury and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (adam), matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and their endogenous inhibitors (timps) in taa formation. methods: thoracic aorta of male sprague-dawley rats was exposed to 0.5m cacl(2) or normal saline (nacl). after 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and cacl(2)-treated, cacl(2)-untreated (n=12) and nacl-treated aortic segments (n=12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments. mmp-timp and adam mrnas were semi-quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. results: despite similar external diameters among cacl(2)-treated, non-cacl(2)-treated and nacl-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n=6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition (n=12, 100%) were demonstrated in cacl(2)-treated segments. mmp-2, mmp-9, adam-10 and adam-17 mrna levels were increased in cacl(2)-treated segments (all p<0.01), with trends of elevation in cacl(2)-untreated segments, as compared with nacl-treated segments. immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of mmp-2, mmp-9, adam-10 and adam-17 (all p<0.01) in intima and media for cacl(2)-treated segments. timp mrna and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments. conclusion: this study establishes a taa model by periarterial cacl(2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of mmp-2, mmp-9, adam10 and adam17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.;1;0;0;0

improvement of levodopa-induced dyskinesia by propranolol in parkinson's disease.;seven patients suffering from parkinson's disease (pd) with severely disabling dyskinesia received low-dose propranolol as an adjunct to the currently used medical treatment. there was a significant 40% improvement in the dyskinesia score without increase of parkinsonian motor disability. ballistic and choreic dyskinesia were markedly ameliorated, whereas dystonia was not. this study suggests that administration of low doses of beta-blockers may improve levodopa-induced ballistic and choreic dyskinesia in pd.;0;0;1;0
naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine.;in unanesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by nalozone, 0.2 to 2 mg/kg. the hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone. naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate. in brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) m, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3h]-naloxone (8 nm), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) m, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3h]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nm). these findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors. as naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site, the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha-methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone.;1;0;1;0

hcds1-mediated phosphorylation of brca1 regulates the dna damage response.;mutations in the brca1 ( ref . 1 ) tumour suppressor gene are found in almost all of the families with inherited breast and ovarian cancers and about half of the families with only breast cancer . although the biochemical function of brca1 is not well understood , it is important for dna damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint . brca1 exists in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and disperses after dna damage . it is not known whether brca1 phosphorylation and dispersion and its function in dna damage response are related . in yeast the dna damage response and the replication-block checkpoint are mediated partly through the cds1 kinase family . here we report that the human cds1 kinase ( hcds1 / chk2 ) regulates brca1 function after dna damage by phosphorylating serine 988 of brca1 . we show that hcds1 and brca1 interact and co-localize within discrete nuclear foci but separate after gamma irradiation . phosphorylation of brca1 at serine 988 is required for the release of brca1 from hcds1 . this phosphorylation is also important for the ability of brca1 to restore survival after dna damage in the brca1-mutated cell line hcc1937 . .;0;0;0;1

genetic mapping of the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome to a small interval on chromosome 17q12-21: exclusion of candidate genes edh17b2 and rara.;a susceptibility gene for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer , brca1 , has been assigned by linkage analysis to chromosome 17q21 . candidate genes in this region include edh17b2 , which encodes estradiol 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ii ( 17 beta-hsd ii ) , and rara , the gene for retinoic acid receptor alpha . we have typed 22 breast and breast-ovarian cancer families with eight polymorphisms from the chromosome 17q12-21 region , including two in the edh17b2 gene . genetic recombination with the breast cancer trait excludes rara from further consideration as a candidate gene for brca1 . both brca1 and edh17b2 map to a 6 cm interval ( between thra1 and d17s579 ) and no recombination was observed between the two genes . however , direct sequencing of overlapping pcr products containing the entire edh17b2 gene in four unrelated affected women did not uncover any sequence variation , other than previously described polymorphisms . mutations in the edh17b2 gene , therefore do not appear to be responsible for the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome . single meiotic crossovers in affected women suggest that brca1 is flanked by the loci rara and d17s78 . .;0;0;1;1

association of drd2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in chinese schizophrenic patients.;aim: extrapyramidal syndrome (eps) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the d2 receptor. recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the drd2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. in this study, we evaluate the role drd2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced eps in schizophrenic patients. methods: we identified seven snp(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141cins>del, taqib, taqid, ser311cys, rs6275, rs6277 and taqia) in the drd2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with eps and 87 without eps according to the simpson-angus scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. the alleles of all loci were determined by pcr (polymerase chain reaction). results: polymorphisms taqid, ser311cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. no statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141cins>del, taqib, rs6275 and taqia or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by taqib, rs6275 and taqia) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. conclusion: our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the drd2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in chinese patients with schizophrenia. our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between drd2 and eps in caucasians.;0;0;1;0
fas preassociation required for apoptosis signaling and dominant inhibition by pathogenic mutations.;heterozygous mutations encoding abnormal forms of the death receptor fas dominantly interfere with fas-induced lymphocyte apoptosis in human autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome . this effect , rather than depending on ligand-induced receptor oligomerization , was found to stem from ligand- independent interaction of wild-type and mutant fas receptors through a specific region in the extracellular domain . preassociated fas complexes were found in living cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between variants of green fluorescent protein . these results show that formation of preassociated receptor complexes is necessary for fas signaling and dominant interference in human disease . .;0;0;1;0

exon 9 mutations in the wt1 gene, without influencing kts splice isoforms, are also responsible for frasier syndrome.;we report new mutations in exon 9 of the wt1 gene that did not alter the ratio of + / - kts splice isoforms in two unrelated patients with frasier syndrome ( fs ) . the mutation of intron 9 inducing defective alternative splicing was reported to be responsible for this syndrome . the mutations found in our cases occurred in the same exon of the wt1 gene as detected in denys-drash syndrome ( dds ) and could not be explained by the previously proposed mechanism . the results suggest that the two syndromes originate from the same wt1 gene abnormality . from a molecular biological point of view , we concluded that the two diseases were not separable , and that fs should be included as an atypical form of dds . .;0;0;1;0
all- trans-retinoic acid-induced erythema nodosum in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.;erythema nodosum associated with all- trans-retinoic acid (atra) for acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl) is very rare. we describe four patients with classic apl who developed erythema nodosum during atra therapy. fever and subsequent multiple painful erythematous nodules over extremities developed on d11, d16, d17, and d19, respectively, after atra therapy. the skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with erythema nodosum. all patients received short course of steroids. fever subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely. all patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of atra. atra seemed to be the most possible etiology of erythema nodosum in our patients. short-term use of steroid is very effective in atra-induced erythema nodosum.;0;0;0;1
drug-induced acute liver injury within 12 hours after fluvastatin therapy.;although statins are generally well-tolerated drugs, recent cases of drug-induced liver injury associated with their use have been reported. a 52-year-old chinese man reported with liver damage, which appeared 12 hours after beginning treatment with fluvastatin. patient presented with complaints of increasing nausea, anorexia, and upper abdominal pain. his laboratory values showed elevated creatine kinase and transaminases. testing for autoantibodies was also negative. the liver biochemistries eventually normalized within 3 weeks of stopping the fluvastatin. therefore, when prescribing statins, the possibility of hepatic damage should be taken into account.;0;1;0;0

water intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortion.;four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortions are described. the mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases. oxytocin administration during midtrimester-induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia, muscular irritability, or headaches. the oxytocin should be given only in ringers lactate or, alternately, in ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions. the urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases. the oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours. if the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance.;0;0;1;0

the negative mucosal potential: separating central and peripheral effects of nsaids in man.;"objective: we wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain-related signal (chemo-somatosensory evoked potential, cssep) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal (negative mucosal potential, nmp) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of nsaids. for this purpose, experimental conditions were created in which nsaids had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms. methods: according to a double-blind, randomised, controlled, threefold cross-over design, 18 healthy subjects (11 males, 7 females; mean age 26 years) received either placebo, 400 mg ibuprofen, or 800 mg ibuprofen. phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of co2 to the nasal mucosa (stimulus duration 500 ms, interval approximately 60 s), and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature, humidity and flow rate (22 degrees c, 0% relative humidity, 145 ml.s-1). both csseps as central and nmps as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the co2 stimuli. additionally, the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scales. results: as described earlier, administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but-relative to placebo-an increase in correlates of phasic pain, indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental conditions. based on the similar behaviour of cssep and nmp, it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery. by means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception, it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an nsaid. the major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain-related activity directly using a non-invasive technique in humans.";0;0;1;0
fatty liver induced by tetracycline in the rat. dose-response relationships and effect of sex.;dose-response relationships, biochemical mechanisms, and sex differences in the experimental fatty liver induced by tetracycline were studied in the intact rat and with the isolated perfused rat liver in vitro. in the intact male and female rat, no direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and hepatic accumulation of triglyceride. with provision of adequate oleic acid as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver, a direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and both accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and depression of output of triglyceride by livers from male and female rats. marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line (control) hepatic concentration of triglyceride and output of triglyceride. accumulation of hepatic triglyceride, as a per cent of control values, in response to graded doses of tetracycline, did not differ significantly between male, female and pregnant rat livers. however, livers from female, and especially pregnant female rats, were strikingly resistant to the effects of tetracycline on depression of output of triglyceride under these experimental conditions. these differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of tetracycline or altered uptake of oleic acid. depressed hepatic secretion of triglyceride accounted only for 30 to 50% of accumulated hepatic triglyceride, indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the triglyceride-rich fatty liver in response to tetracycline.;0;1;1;0
von willebrand disease type b: a missense mutation selectively abolishes ristocetin-induced von willebrand factor binding to platelet glycoprotein ib.;von willebrand factor ( vwf ) is a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium by binding to platelet glycoprotein ib . for human vwf , this interaction can be induced in vitro by the antibiotic ristocetin or the snake venom protein botrocetin . a missense mutation , gly-561-- > ser , was identified within the proposed glycoprotein ib binding domain of vwf in the proband with von willebrand disease type b , a unique variant characterized by no ristocetin-induced , but normal botrocetin-induced , binding to glycoprotein ib . the corresponding mutant recombinant protein , rvwf ( g561s ) , formed normal multimers and exhibited the same functional defect as the patients plasma vwf , confirming that this mutation causes von willebrand disease type b . these data show that botrocetin and ristocetin cofactor activities of vwf can be dissociated by a point mutation and confirm that these mediators promote vwf binding to platelets by different mechanisms . the normal botrocetin-induced binding and the defective ristocetin-induced binding of rvwf ( g561s ) suggest that the primary defect in von willebrand disease type b may be a failure of normal allosteric regulation of the glycoprotein ib binding function of vwf . .;0;0;1;0

myocardial fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to azt-induced cardiomyopathy.;"background: dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) and myocarditis occur in many hiv-infected individuals, resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5% of patients. highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids), but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies. methods and results: in order to investigate whether the haart component zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine; azt) triggers the fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of dcm, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing fas ligand in the myocardium: fasl tg) and non-transgenic (ntg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of azt (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml). after 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods. ntg and untreated fasl tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function. in contrast, azt-treated fasl tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles. these changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of fas and fasl, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis. these were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin i localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity. conclusions: the expression of fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in hiv-positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to haart-induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction.";1;0;0;0
noradrenergic involvement in catalepsy induced by delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol.;in order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (thc), the effect of pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) or with desipramine and 6-ohda and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats. the cataleptogenic effect of thc was significantly reduced in rats treated with 6-ohda and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with desipramine and 6-ohda, as compared with control rats. on the contrary, the cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol was significantly reduced in rats treated with desipramine and 6-ohda but not in rats treated with 6-ohda or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus. these results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of catalepsy induced by thc, whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in catalepsy induced by haloperidol.;0;0;1;0

a metoprolol-terbinafine combination induced bradycardia.;to report a sinus bradycardia induced by metoprolol and terbinafine drug-drug interaction and its management. a 63 year-old caucasian man on metoprolol 200 mg/day for stable coronary artery disease was prescribed a 90-day course of oral terbinafine 250 mg/day for onychomycosis. on the 49th day of terbinafine therapy, he was brought to the emergency room for a decrease of his global health status, confusion and falls. the electrocardiogram revealed a 37 beats/min sinus bradycardia. a score of 7 on the naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the patient's sinus bradycardia and the drug interaction between metoprolol and terbinafine. the heart rate ameliorated first with a decrease in the dose of metoprolol. it was subsequently changed to bisoprolol and the heart rate remained normal. by inhibiting the cytochrome p450 2d6, terbinafine had decreased metoprolol's clearance, leading in metoprolol accumulation which has resulted in clinically significant sinus bradycardia.;1;0;0;0

the gene for familial mediterranean fever, mefv, is expressed in early leukocyte development and is regulated in response to inflammatory mediators.;familial mediterranean fever ( fmf ) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever and neutrophil-mediated serosal inflammation . we recently identified the gene causing fmf , designated mefv , and found it to be expressed in mature neutrophils , suggesting that it functions as an inflammatory regulator . to facilitate our understanding of the normal function of mefv , we extended our previous studies . mefv messenger rna was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow leukocytes , with differential expression observed among cells by in situ hybridization . cd34 hematopoietic stem-cell cultures induced toward the granulocytic lineage expressed mefv at the myelocyte stage , concurrently with lineage commitment . the prepromyelocytic cell line hl60 expressed mefv only at granulocytic and monocytic differentiation . mefv was also expressed in the monocytic cell lines u937 and thp-1 . among peripheral blood leukocytes , mefv expression was detected in neutrophils , eosinophils , and to varying degrees , monocytes . consistent with the tissue specificity of expression , complete sequencing and analysis of upstream regulatory regions of mefv revealed homology to myeloid-specific promoters and to more broadly expressed inflammatory promoter elements . in vitro stimulation of monocytes with the proinflammatory agents interferon ( ifn ) gamma , tumor necrosis factor , and lipopolysaccharide induced mefv expression , whereas the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin ( il ) 4 , il-10 , and transforming growth factor beta inhibited such expression . induction by ifn-gamma occurred rapidly and was resistant to cycloheximide . ifn-alpha also induced mefv expression . in granulocytes , mefv was up-regulated by ifn-gamma and the combination of ifn-alpha and colchicine . these results refine understanding of mefv by placing the gene in the myelomonocytic-specific proinflammatory pathway and identifying it as an ifn-gamma immediate early gene . .;0;0;0;1

chromosome mapping of the rod photoreceptor cgmp phosphodiesterase beta-subunit gene in mouse and human: tight linkage to the huntington disease region (4p16.;3). the retinal degeneration mouse ( gene symbol , rd ) is an animal model for certain forms of human hereditary retinopathies . recent findings of a nonsense mutation in the rd mouse pde beta-subunit gene ( pdeb ) prompted us to investigate the chromosome locations of the mouse and human genes . we have utilized backcross analysis in mice to verify and define more precisely the location of the pdeb locus 6 . 1 + / - 2 . 3 cm distal of mgsa on mouse chromosome 5 . we have determined that the human gene ( pdeb ) maps to 4p16 . 3 , very close to the huntington disease ( hd ) region . analysis of the comparative map for mice and humans shows that the mouse homologue of the hd gene will reside on chromosome 5 . linkage of the mouse pdeb locus with other homologues in the human 4p16 . 3 region is maintained but gene order is not , suggesting at least three possible sites for the corresponding mouse hd gene .;0;0;1;0

long-term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system.;forty patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma treated with vincristine between 1984 and 1990 (cumulative dose 12 mg in 18-24 weeks) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system. the patients were interviewed with emphasis on neuropathic symptoms. physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed, four to 77 months (median 34 months) after vincristine treatment. twenty-seven patients reported neuropathic symptoms. in 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination. in these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated. in the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past. symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy. there was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination. normal reflexes were found in two third of patients. neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term. it is concluded that with the above mentioned vincristine dose schedule signs and symptoms of vincristine neuropathy are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good.;0;0;1;1
a potential animal model for lesch-nyhan syndrome through introduction of hprt mutations into mice.;the human lesch-nyhan syndrome is a rare neurological and behavioural disorder , affecting only males , which is caused by an inherited deficiency in the level of activity of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanosine phosphoribosyl transferase ( hprt ) . how the resulting alterations in purine metabolism lead to the severe symptoms characteristic of lesch-nyhan patients is still not understood . no mutations at the hprt locus leading to loss of activity have been described in laboratory animals . to derive an animal model for the lesch-nyhan syndrome , we have used cultured mouse embryonic stem cells , mutagenized by retroviral insertion and selected for loss of hprt activity , to construct chimaeric mice . two clonal lines carrying different mutant hprt alleles have given rise to germ cells in chimaeras , allowing the derivation of strains of mutant mice having the same biochemical defect as lesch-nyhan patients . male mice carrying the mutant alleles are viable and analysis of their cells shows a total lack of hprt activity . .;0;0;1;0
mesangial function and glomerular sclerosis in rats with aminonucleoside nephrosis.;"the possible relationship between mesangial dysfunction and development of glomerular sclerosis was studied in the puromycin aminonucleoside (pan) model. five male wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous pan injections; five controls received saline only. after 4 weeks the pan rats were severely proteinuric (190 +/- 80 mg/24 hr), and all rats were given colloidal carbon (cc) intravenously. at 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7.6 +/- 3.4% of the glomeruli of pan rats; glomeruli of the controls were normal. glomeruli of pan rats contained significantly more cc than glomeruli of controls. glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more cc than non-sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys. cc was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli. since mesangial cc clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic pan treatment, we conclude that this preferential cc localization within the lesions is caused by an increased cc uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequently. cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the pan glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model. similar to the remnant kidney model in pan nephrosis the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to ""mesangial overloading.""";0;1;0;0
evidence for a cholinergic role in haloperidol-induced catalepsy.;experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes catalepsy and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. large doses of the cholinomimetic, pilocarpine, could induce catalepsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked. low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catalepsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol. a muscarinic receptor blocker, atropine, disrupted haloperidol-induced catalepsy. intracranial injection of an acetylcholine-synthesis inhibitor, hemicholinium, prevented the catalepsy that is usually induced by haloperidol. these findings suggest the hypothesis that the catalepsy that is produced by neuroleptics such as haloperidol is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems. alternatively, activation of central cholinergic systems could promote catalepsy by suppression of dopaminergic systems.;0;0;1;0

mild and severe muscular dystrophy associated with deletions in xp21 of the human x chromosome.;we have analysed over 300 patients suffering from duchenne or becker muscular dystrophy ( dmd or bmd ) . deletions have been characterised which encompass either the pert87 ( dxs164 ) locus only , the xj1 . 1 ( dxs206 ) and hip25 loci only , or all three loci . these loci have been shown to lie within the dmd region covering several hundred kilobases ( kb ) of dna . one mildly affected bmd patient possesses a deletion of at least 110 kb including exons of the dmd gene . other patients with similar exon deletions , or smaller deletions , show the more severe phenotype typical of dmd . we conclude from these studies that the severity of the clinical phenotype cannot be explained on the basis of the size of the deletion . we discuss this in the context of candidate gene sequences .;0;0;1;0
iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant yeast frataxin: implications for friedreich ataxia.;frataxin deficiency is the primary cause of friedreich ataxia ( frda ) , an autosomal recessive cardiodegenerative and neurodegenerative disease . frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes . genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue ( yfh1p ) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress . increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with frda . these findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals . the functional mechanism of frataxin , however , is still unknown . we have expressed the mature form of yfh1p ( myfh1p ) in escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro . isolated myfh1p is a soluble monomer ( 13 , 783 da ) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate . aerobic addition of ferrous iron to myfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1 . 1 mda ( megadaltons ) and a diameter of 13 + / -2 nm . each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester > 3 , 000 atoms of iron . titration of myfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly . sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer , indicating that myfh1p sequesters iron in an available form . in yeast mitochondria , native myfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight > 600 , 000 . after addition of ( 55 ) fe to the medium , immunoprecipitates of this species contain > 16 atoms of ( 55 ) fe per molecule of myfh1p . we propose that iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant myfh1p reflects a physiological role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and bioavailability . .;1;0;1;0
analysis of alkaptonuria (aku) mutations and polymorphisms reveals that the ccc sequence motif is a mutational hot spot in the homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase gene (hgo).;"we recently showed that alkaptonuria ( aku ) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the homogentisate 1 , 2 dioxygenase gene ( hgo ) . herein we describe haplotype and mutational analyses of hgo in seven new aku pedigrees . these analyses identified two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( inv4 + 31a-- > g and inv11 + 18a-- > g ) and six novel aku mutations ( inv1-1g-- > a , w60g , y62c , a122d , p230t , and d291e ) , which further illustrates the remarkable allelic heterogeneity found in aku . reexamination of all 29 mutations and polymorphisms thus far described in hgo shows that these nucleotide changes are not randomly distributed ; the ccc sequence motif and its inverted complement , ggg , are preferentially mutated . these analyses also demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in hgo do not involve cpg dinucleotides , which illustrates important differences between hgo and other genes for the occurrence of mutation at specific short-sequence motifs . because the ccc sequence motifs comprise a significant proportion ( 34 . 5 % ) of all mutated bases that have been observed in hgo , we conclude that the ccc triplet is a mutational hot spot in hgo .";0;0;1;0
arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy: a complication associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.;arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy. characteristic of the entity is arterial occlusion by platelet-fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy, preceded by profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 per cubic millimeter. the clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin, and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications. previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are reviewed. the common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin-induced platelet aggregation. appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of heparin, and anticoagulation with sodium warfarin if necessary. vascular procedures are performed as indicated.;0;0;1;0
cocaine, ethanol, and cocaethylene cardiotoxity in an animal model of cocaine and ethanol abuse.;"objectives: simultaneous abuse of cocaine and ethanol affects 12 million americans annually. in combination, these substances are substantially more toxic than either drug alone. their combined cardiac toxicity may be due to independent effects of each drug; however, they may also be due to cocaethylene (ce), a cocaine metabolite formed only in the presence of ethanol. the purpose of this study was to delineate the role of ce in the combined cardiotoxicity of cocaine and ethanol in a model simulating their abuse. methods: twenty-three dogs were randomized to receive either 1) three intravenous (iv) boluses of cocaine 7.5 mg/kg with ethanol (1 g/kg) as an iv infusion (c+e, n = 8), 2) three cocaine boluses only (c, n = 6), 3) ethanol infusion only (e, n = 5), or 4) placebo boluses and infusion (n = 4). hemodynamic measurements, electrocardiograms, and serum drug concentrations were obtained at baseline, and then at fixed time intervals after each drug was administered. results: two of eight dogs in the c+e group experienced cardiovascular collapse. the most dramatic hemodynamic changes occurred after each cocaine bolus in the c+e and c only groups; however, persistent hemodynamic changes occurred in the c+e group. peak ce levels were associated with a 45% (sd +/- 22%, 95% ci = 22% to 69%) decrease in cardiac output (p < 0.05), a 56% (sd +/- 23%, 95% ci = 32% to 80%) decrease in dp/dt(max) (p <.006), and a 23% (sd +/- 15%, 95% ci = 7% to 49%) decrease in svo(2) (p < 0.025). ventricular arrhythmias were primarily observed in the c+e group, in which four of eight dogs experienced ventricular tachycardia. conclusions: cocaine and ethanol in combination were more toxic than either substance alone. co-administration resulted in prolonged cardiac toxicity and was dysrhythmogenic. peak serum cocaethylene concentrations were associated with prolonged myocardial depression.";1;0;1;0

safety and adverse effects associated with raloxifene: multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation.;"objective: to examine the effect of raloxifene on major adverse events that occur with postmenopausal estrogen therapy or tamoxifen. methods: the multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. women were randomly assigned to raloxifene 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d or placebo. outcomes included venous thromboembolism, cataracts, gallbladder disease, and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. results: during a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (relative risk [rr] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.2-3.8). the excess event rate was 1.8 per 1,000 woman-years (95% ci -0.5-4.1), and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 (95% ci 100-582) over 3.3 years. risk in the raloxifene group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years, but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter. raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts (rr 0.9; 95% ci 0.8-1.1), gallbladder disease (rr 1.0; 95% ci 0.7-1.3), endometrial hyperplasia (rr 1.3; 95% ci 0.4-5.1), or endometrial cancer (rr 0.9; 95% ci 0.3-2.7). conclusion: raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism, but there was no increased risk for cataracts, gallbladder disease, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. level of evidence: i";0;0;0;1
cerebral vasculitis following oral methylphenidate intake in an adult: a case report.;methylphenidate is structurally and functionally similar to amphetamine. cerebral vasculitis associated with amphetamine abuse is well documented, and in rare cases ischaemic stroke has been reported after methylphenidate intake in children. we report the case of a 63-year-old female who was treated with methylphenidate due to hyperactivity and suffered from multiple ischaemic strokes. we consider drug-induced cerebral vasculitis as the most likely cause of recurrent ischaemic strokes in the absence of any pathological findings during the diagnostic work-up. we conclude that methylphenidate mediated vasculitis should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of methylphenidate therapy. this potential side-effect, though very rare, represents one more reason to be very restrictive in the use of methylphenidate.;0;0;1;0

genotype and phenotype in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency .;dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( dpd ) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by thymine-uraciluria in homozygous deficient patients and has been associated with a variable clinical phenotype . in order to understand the genetic and phenotypic basis for dpd deficiency , we have reviewed 17 families presenting 22 patients with complete deficiency of dpd . in this group of patients , 7 different mutations have been identified , including 2 deletions [ 295-298deltcat , 1897delc ] , 1 splice-site mutation [ ivs14 + 1g > a ) ] and 4 missense mutations ( 85t > c , 703c > t , 2658g > a , 2983g > t ) . analysis of the prevalence of the various mutations among dpd patients has shown that the g-- > a point mutation in the invariant splice donor site is by far the most common ( 52 % ) , whereas the other six mutations are less frequently observed . a large phenotypic variability has been observed , with convulsive disorders , motor retardation and mental retardation being the most abundant manifestations . a clear correlation between the genotype and phenotype has not been established . an altered beta-alanine , uracil and thymine homeostasis might underlie the various clinical abnormalities encountered in patients with dpd deficiency .;0;1;1;0

pharmacological evidence for the potential of daucus carota in the management of cognitive dysfunctions.;the present study was aimed at investigating the effects of daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. the ethanolic extract of daucus carota seeds (dce) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. dce (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. the extent of memory improvement evoked by dce was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze. similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice. furthermore, dce reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). daucus carota extract (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice. the extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by dce at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice. there was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of dce. therefore, dce may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.;0;0;1;0
"""real-world"" data on the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who were treated according to the standard clinical practice: a study of the greek myeloma study group.";"lenalidomide and dexamethasone (rd) is a standard of care for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (rrmm), but there is limited published data on its efficacy and safety in the ""real world"" (rw), according to the international society of pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research definition. we studied 212 rrmm patients who received rd in rw. objective response (>pr (partial response)) rate was 77.4 % (complete response (cr), 20.2 %). median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months, respectively. median time to cr when rd was given as 2nd or >2(nd)-line treatment at 4 and 11 months, respectively. quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to thalidomide or bortezomib. median duration of response was 34.4 months, and it was higher in patients who received rd until progression (not reached versus 19 months, p < 0.001). improvement of humoral immunity occurred in 60 % of responders (p < 0.001) and in the majority of patients who achieved stable disease. adverse events were reported in 68.9 % of patients (myelosuppression in 49.4 %) and 12.7 % of patients needed hospitalization. peripheral neuropathy was observed only in 2.5 % of patients and deep vein thrombosis in 5.7 %. dose reductions were needed in 31 % of patients and permanent discontinuation in 38.9 %. median time to treatment discontinuation was 16.8 months. performance status (ps) and initial lenalidomide dose predicted for treatment discontinuation. extra-medullary relapses occurred in 3.8 % of patients. our study confirms that rd is effective and safe in rrmm in the rw; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease.";0;0;1;0

enhanced stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow in epinephrine-induced hypertensive rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation.;the present study examines the effect of 6-day epinephrine treatment (100 micrograms/kg per h, s.c.) on stimulus-induced (1 hz) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle- and epinephrine-treated rats. renal catecholamine stores and stimulus-induced overflow in the vehicle-treated group consisted of norepinephrine only. however, epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40% of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was reduced by a similar degree. total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged. stimulus-induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine-treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidney. this difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade. propranolol had no effect on stimulus-induced overflow in either group. phentolamine increased stimulus-induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine-treated group. in conclusion, chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow. however, neither alterations in prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration. furthermore, data obtained with phentolamine alone do not suggest alpha-adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment.;0;1;1;0

metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of parkinson's disease.;metabotropic glutamate (mglu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of parkinson's disease (pd). among the eight mglu receptor subtypes, mglu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of pd is not known. the effects of n,n'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (amn082), the first selective allosteric activator of mglu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of pd. here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of amn082 reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. amn082 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) reduces apomorphine-induced rotations in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda)-lesioned rats. in a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of pd patients, 5 mg/kg amn082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-ohda-lesioned rats. in addition, amn082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in a mglu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mglu7 receptor knockout mice. higher doses of amn082 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of pd. overall these findings suggest that mglu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity. selective ligands of mglu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies.;0;0;1;0

modification of drug action by hyperammonemia.;pretreatment with ammonium acetate (nh4ac) (6 mmol/kg s.c.) approximately doubled the time morphine-treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular incoordination by diazepam, but nh4ac treatment alone had no effect. thus, hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease. experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine-induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mm nh4ac and kcl-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mm nh4ac. addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium-independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by nh4ac. these results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels. parallels in the actions of nh4ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept. both verapamil (10 mg/kg i.p.) and nh4ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia- and diazepam-induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine-induced motor activity, and neither verapamil nor nh4ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol. the data suggest that hyperammonemia exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics.;0;1;0;0
novel mutations of the atp7b gene in japanese patients with wilson disease.;wilson disease ( wd ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the liver , brain , kidneys , and corneas , and culminating in copper toxication in these organs . in this study , we analyzed mutations of the responsible gene , atp7b , in four japanese patients with wd . by direct sequencing , we identified five mutations , of which two were novel , and 16 polymorphisms , of which 6 were novel . the mutations 2871delc and 2513dela shift the reading frame so that truncated abnormal protein is expected . in contrast to these mutations found in patients with hepatic-type of early onset , the mutations a874v , r778l , and 3892delgtc were either missense mutations or in frame 1-amino acid deletion , and occurred in the patients with hepato-neurologic type of late onset . the mutations 2871delc and r778l have been previously reported in a relatively large number of japanese patients . in particular , r778l is known to be more prevalent in asian countries than in other countries of the world . our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the mutations tend to occur in a population-specific manner . therefore , the accumulation of the types of mutations in japanese patients with wd will facilitate the fast and effective genetic diagnosis of wd in japanese patients . .;0;1;1;0

molecular and phenotypic analysis of patients with deletions within the deletion-rich region of the duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) gene.;"eighty unrelated individuals with duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd )or becker muscular dystrophy ( bmd ) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the dmd locus . this region includes the last five exons detected by cdna5b-7 , all exons detected by cdna8 , and the first two exons detected by cdna9 . these 80 individuals account for approximately 75 % of 109 deletions of the gene , detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cdna . endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes , p20 ( dxs269 ; wapenaar et al . ) and gmgx11 ( dxs239 ; present paper ) . clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype . thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as dmd , bmd , or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron / exon boundaries . of these , eight bmd patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact , while 21 dmd patients , 7 intermediate patients , and 1 bmd patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame . thus , with two exceptions , frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions . this is in agreement with recent findings by baumbach et al . and koenig et al . but is in contrast to findings , by malhotra et al . at the 5 ' end of the gene .";0;0;1;0

ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.;"we followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years. thirty-six of the 210 patients (17.2%) developed iridocyclitis. iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients (0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis. however, 30% of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age. although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry. our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases. forty-four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency. even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics. despite this, there was a dramatic decrease in the 50% incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies. cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13% of our group, respectively. we used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs. systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found. typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases. this association with uveitis and jra was not noted previously. surgical treatment of cataracts, band keratopathy, and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results.";0;0;1;0

ocular motility changes after subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy for retinoblastoma.;background: focal subtenon carboplatin injections have recently been used as a presumably toxicity-free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma. objective: to report our clinical experience with abnormal ocular motility in patients treated with subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy. methods: we noted abnormal ocular motility in 10 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma who had received subtenon carboplatin. during ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing, comparing ocular motility after tumor control with ocular motility at diagnosis. eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure (n = 4) were examined histologically. results: limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular retinoblastoma with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of multimodality therapy. histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye, indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necrosis. the enucleations were technically difficult and hazardous for globe rupture because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions. conclusions: subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with significant fibrosis of orbital soft tissues, leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficult. subtenon carboplatin is not free of toxicity, and its use is best restricted to specific indications.;0;0;0;1
carbamazepine-induced cardiac dysfunction. characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes.;a patient with sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, induced by carbamazepine, prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases. from the analysis of these cases, two distinct forms of carbamazepine-associated cardiac dysfunction emerged. one patient group developed sinus tachycardias in the setting of a massive carbamazepine overdose. the second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life-threatening bradyarrhythmias or atrioventricular conduction delay, associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated carbamazepine serum levels. because carbamazepine is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and psychiatric conditions, the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients.;1;0;1;0
case-control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use and end-stage renal disease.;background: studies on the association between the long-term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and end-stage renal disease (esrd) have given conflicting results. in order to examine this association, a case-control study with incident cases of esrd was carried out. methods: the cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of esrd in the study area between june 1, 1995 and november 30, 1997. they were classified according to the underlying disease, which had presumably led them to esrd. controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose, also matched by age and sex. odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model, including potential confounding factors, both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases. results: five hundred and eighty-three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis. long-term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1.22 (95% ci, 0.89-1.66). for specific groups of drugs, the risks were 1.56 (1.05-2.30) for aspirin, 1.03 (0.60-1.76) for pyrazolones, 0.80 (0.39-1.63) for paracetamol, and 0.94 (0.57-1.56) for nonaspirin nsaids. the risk of esrd associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use, and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [2.35 (1.17-4.72)]. conclusion: our data indicate that long-term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and nsaids is not associated with an increased risk of esrd. however, the chronic use of aspirin may increase the risk of esrd.;0;1;0;0

trimethoprim-induced immune hemolytic anemia in a pediatric oncology patient presenting as an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.;a 10-year-old male with acute leukemia presented with post-chemotherapy anemia. during red cell transfusion, he developed hemoglobinuria. transfusion reaction workup was negative. drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia was suspected because of positive direct antiglobulin test, negative eluate, and microspherocytes on smear pre- and post-transfusion. drug studies using the indirect antiglobulin test were strongly positive with trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but negative with sulfamethoxazole. the patient recovered after discontinuing the drug, with no recurrence in 2 years. other causes of anemia should be considered in patients with worse-than-expected anemia after chemotherapy. furthermore, hemolysis during transfusion is not always a transfusion reaction.;0;0;0;1
cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats: involvement of nuclear factor kappa b and oxidative stress, and prevention by topiramate.;different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced-behaviour is poorly understood. nuclear factor kappa b (nfkappab) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms. therefore nfkappab activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nnos) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats. nfkappab activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as gsh concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nnos activity in the hippocampus was increased. memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with nfkappab activity in the frontal cortex. in contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nnos activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase. these results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and nfkappab in the alterations induced by cocaine. topiramate prevented all the alterations observed, showing novel neuroprotective properties.;0;0;1;0

frequency of transient ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia.;background: especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers. temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis. we therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences. methods: this prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 ml of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic. results: all patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis. it resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. there were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without. conclusion: local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. in patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.;0;0;1;0

an integrated characterization of serological, pathological, and functional events in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.;"many efficacious cancer treatments cause significant cardiac morbidity, yet biomarkers or functional indices of early damage, which would allow monitoring and intervention, are lacking. in this study, we have utilized a rat model of progressive doxorubicin (dox)-induced cardiomyopathy, applying multiple approaches, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (mri), to provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the timecourse of serological, pathological, and functional events underlying this toxicity. hannover wistar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg/kg dox weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off-dosing ""recovery"" period. electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed subcellular degeneration and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dose. histopathological analysis revealed progressive cardiomyocyte degeneration, hypertrophy/cytomegaly, and extensive vacuolation after two doses. extensive replacement fibrosis (quantified by sirius red staining) developed during the off-dosing period. functional indices assessed by cardiac mri (including left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef), cardiac output, and e/a ratio) declined progressively, reaching statistical significance after two doses and culminating in ""clinical"" lv dysfunction by 12 weeks. significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin i (ctni) emerged after eight doses, importantly preceding the lvef decline to <50%. troponin i levels positively correlated with delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement, histopathological grading, and diastolic dysfunction. in summary, subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration was the earliest marker, followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations. myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in ctni occurred later. however, all indices predated ""clinical"" lv dysfunction and thus warrant further evaluation as predictive biomarkers.";1;0;0;1
end-stage renal disease (esrd) after orthotopic liver transplantation (oltx) using calcineurin-based immunotherapy: risk of development and treatment.;"background: the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic. their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (oltx) has dramatically improved success rates. recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after oltx with end-stage renal disease (esrd). this retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of esrd and chronic renal failure (crf) in oltx patients. methods: patients receiving an oltx only from june 1985 through december of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). our prospectively collected database was the source of information. patients were divided into three groups: controls, no crf or esrd, n=748; crf, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and esrd, n=45. groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of esrd therapy, and survival from onset of esrd. results: at 13 years after oltx, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (crf 8.6% and esrd 9.5%). compared with control patients, crf and esrd patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine. multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of crf or esrd with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. overall survival from the time of oltx was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had esrd was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group. patients developing esrd had a 6-year survival after onset of esrd of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing esrd who subsequently received kidney transplants. conclusions: patients who are more than 10 years post-oltx have crf and esrd at a high rate. the development of esrd decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only. patients who develop esrd have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. however, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of crf or esrd. new strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication.";0;1;0;0

adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics. collaborative working group on clinical trial evaluations.;adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance. thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health. the side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (eps), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. the newer atypical agents have a lower risk of eps, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold (primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis (clozapine only). since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.;1;1;1;0

detection of heterozygous mutations in brca1 using high density oligonucleotide arrays and two-colour fluorescence analysis.;the ability to scan a large gene rapidly and accurately for all possible heterozygous mutations in large numbers of patient samples will be critical for the future of medicine . we have designed high-density arrays consisting of over 96 , 600 oligonucleotides 20-nucleotides ( nt ) in length to screen for a wide range of heterozygous mutations in the 3 . 45-kilobases ( kb ) exon 11 of the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene brca1 . reference and test samples were co-hybridized to these arrays and differences in hybridization patterns quantitated by two-colour analysis . fourteen of fifteen patient samples with known mutations were accurately diagnosed , and no false positive mutations were identified in 20 control samples . eight single nucleotide polymorphisms were also readily detected . dna chip-based assays may provide a valuable new technology for high-throughput cost-efficient detection of genetic alterations .;0;0;1;1
effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with valproate or clonazepam in amygdala-kindled rats.;loreclezole (5 mg/kg) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala-kindled rats, reducing both seizure and afterdischarge durations. the combinations of loreclezole (2.5 mg/kg) with valproate, clonazepam, or carbamazepine (applied at their subprotective doses) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test. however, only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature. among several chemoconvulsants, bicuculline, n-methyl-d-aspartic acid and bay k-8644 (the opener of l-type calcium channels) reversed the protective activity of loreclezole alone and its combination with valproate. on the other hand, bicuculline, aminophylline and bay k-8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of loreclezole combined with clonazepam. the results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of gabaergic neurotransmission and blockade of l-type of calcium channels.;0;0;1;0

heart failure: to digitalise or not? the view against.;despite extensive clinical experience the role of digoxin is still not well defined. in patients with atrial fibrillation digoxin is beneficial for ventricular rate control. for patients in sinus rhythm and heart failure the situation is less clear. digoxin has a narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio and concentrations are affected by a number of drugs. also, digoxin has undesirable effects such as increasing peripheral resistance and myocardial demands, and causing arrhythmias. there is a paucity of data from well-designed trials. the trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit. more convincing evidence is required showing that digoxin improves symptoms or exercise capacity. furthermore, no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality. pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that digoxin may increase mortality after myocardial infarction (mi). angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors should be used first as they are safer, do not require blood level monitoring, modify progression of disease, relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality. caution should be exercised in using digoxin until large mortality trials are completed showing either benefit or harm. until then digoxin should be considered a third-line therapy.;1;0;1;0

myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells.;"myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) , the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults , is caused by ( ctg ) n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase ( dm protein kinase ; dmpk ) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis . to obtain clues to the normal biological role of dmpk in cellular ion homeostasis , we have compared the resting [ ca2 + ] i , the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced ca2 + transients , and the content of atp-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and dmpk [ - / - ] knockout mice . in vitro-differentiated dmpk [ - / - ] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [ ca2 + ] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type ca2 + and na + channels . the mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external k + . in addition , we observed that these ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular ca2 + through the l-type ca2 + channel . neither the content nor the activity of na + / k + atpase and sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2 + -atpase are affected by dmpk absence . in conclusion , our data suggest that dmpk is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle . .";0;0;1;0
the risk of venous thromboembolism in women prescribed cyproterone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol: a nested cohort analysis and case-control study.;background: cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl estradiol (cpa/ee) is licensed in the uk for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment option for polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (vte) associated with cpa/ee compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives (cocs). we believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding. methods: using the general practice research database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne, hirsutism or pcos to estimate the risk of vte associated with cpa/ee. results: the age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for cpa/ee versus conventional cocs was 2.20 [95% confidence interval (ci) 1.35-3.58]. using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception, had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms, the case-control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio (or(adj)) of 7.44 (95% ci 3.67-15.08) for cpa/ee use compared with an or(adj) of 2.58 (95% ci 1.60-4.18) for use of conventional cocs. conclusions: we have demonstrated an increased risk of vte associated with the use of cpa/ee in women with acne, hirsutism or pcos although residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded.;0;0;1;0
mechanisms of fk 506-induced hypertension in the rat.;-tacrolimus (fk 506) is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant. the clinical utility of fk 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity. to clarify the mechanisms of fk 506-induced hypertension, we studied the chronic effects of fk 506 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (et-1), the expression of mrna of et-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ece-1), the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) activity, and the expression of mrna of enos and c-type natriuretic peptide (cnp) in rat blood vessels. in addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type a receptor antagonist fr 139317 on fk 506-induced hypertension in rats was studied. fk 506, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+/-13 to 152+/-15 mm hg and increased the synthesis of et-1 and the levels of et-1 mrna in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively). little change was observed in the expression of ece-1 mrna and cnp mrna. fk 506 decreased enos activity and the levels of enos mrna in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively). the administration of fr 139317 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented fk 506-induced hypertension in rats. these results indicate that fk 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing et-1 production but also by decreasing no synthesis in the vasculature.;1;1;1;0
rapid detection of brca1 mutations by the protein truncation test.;more than 75 % of the reported mutations in the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene , brca1 , result in truncated proteins . we have used the protein truncation test ( ptt ) to screen for mutations in exon 11 , which encodes 61 % of brca1 . in 45 patients from breast and / or ovarian cancer families we found six novel mutations  two single nucleotide insertions , three small deletions ( 1-5 bp ) and a nonsense mutation identified two unrelated families . furthermore , we were able to amplify the remaining coding region by rt-pcr using lymphocyte rna . combined with ptt , we detected aberrantly spliced products affecting exons 5 and 6 in one of two brca1-linked families examined . the protein truncation test promises to become a valuable technique in detecting brca1 mutations . .;0;0;0;1
a pilot study to assess the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the emergency department evaluation of cocaine-associated chest pain.;study objective: chest pain in the setting of cocaine use poses a diagnostic dilemma. dobutamine stress echocardiography (dse) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating cardiac ischemia. because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of dobutamine in the setting of cocaine use, we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of dse in emergency department patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. methods: a prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ed of an urban tertiary-care teaching hospital. patients were eligible for dse if they had used cocaine within 24 hours preceding the onset of chest pain and had a normal ecg and tropinin i level. patients exhibiting signs of continuing cocaine toxicity were excluded from the study. all patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the dse testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit. results: twenty-four patients were enrolled. two patients had inadequate resting images, one dse was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis, another dse was terminated because of a rate-related atrial conduction deficit, and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate. thus, 19 patients completed a dse and reached their target heart rates. none of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias (excluding sinus tachycardia). further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response, 13 (65%) of 20 patients required supplemental atropine to reach their target heart rates. conclusion: no exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when dobutamine was administered to patients with cocaine-related chest pain.;1;0;0;0
early onset of x-linked emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy in a boy with emerin gene deletion.;a boy developed contractures of the achilles tendons at 3 years and of the postcervical muscles at 7 years , although neither contractures of the elbows nor cardiac abnormality were recognized by the age of 9 years . muscle computed tomography scanning revealed changes characteristic of muscle involvement . emerin was not detected in the biopsied muscle , and rt-pcr and pcr-based genomic dna analyses of the emerin gene demonstrated no amplification product in the patient . these results confirmed the diagnosis of x-linked emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( edmd ) , and reinforce the necessity of molecular genetic diagnosis of the membrane protein emerin in younger patients with possible edmd before appearance of the typical symptoms , to avoid sudden cardiac death . .;0;0;1;0

low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves.;"background: the interruption of oral anticoagulant (oac) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non-surgical interventions, and pregnancy. unfractionated heparin (uh) is currently the substitute for selected patients. low-molecular-weight heparin (lmwh) offers theoretical advantages over uh, but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to uh in patients with prosthetic valves. hypothesis: the aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of lmwh in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice. methods: for this paper, the current medical literature on lmwh in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed. results: there were eight series and six case reports. none of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective. data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete. after excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: (a) short-term administration, after valve insertion (n = 212); (b) short-term, perioperative (noncardiac)/periprocedural (n = 114); (c) long-term, due to intolerance to oac (n = 16); (d) long-term, in pregnancy (n = 10). the incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0.9% for all the studies and 0.5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for hemorrhage, the overall rate was 3.4% (3.8, 2.6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups). conclusions: in patients with mechanical heart valves, short-term lmwh therapy compares favorably with uh. data on mid- and long-term lmwh administration in these patients are sparse. further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of lmwh in patients with mechanical heart valves.";1;0;0;0

association of brca1 with the hrad50-hmre11-p95 complex and the dna damage response.;brca1 encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers . here , it is shown that brca1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hrad50 , which forms a complex with hmre11 and p95 / nibrin . upon irradiation , brca1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus , which colocalize with hrad50 . formation of irradiation-induced foci positive for brca1 , hrad50 , hmre11 , or p95 was dramatically reduced in hcc / 1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in brca1 but was restored by transfection of wild-type brca1 . ectopic expression of wild-type , but not mutated , brca1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the dna damage agent , methyl methanesulfonate . these data suggest that brca1 is important for the cellular responses to dna damage that are mediated by the hrad50-hmre11-p95 complex . .;0;0;1;1

aminoglycoside antibiotics restore dystrophin function to skeletal muscles of mdx mice.;duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene , leading to the absence of the dystrophin protein in striated muscle . a significant number of these mutations are premature stop codons . on the basis of the observation that aminoglycoside treatment can suppress stop codons in cultured cells , we tested the effect of gentamicin on cultured muscle cells from the mdx mouse - an animal model for dmd that possesses a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene . exposure of mdx myotubes to gentamicin led to the expression and localization of dystrophin to the cell membrane . we then evaluated the effects of differing dosages of gentamicin on expression and functional protection of the muscles of mdx mice . we identified a treatment regimen that resulted in the presence of dystrophin in the cell membrane in all striated muscles examined and that provided functional protection against muscular injury . to our knowledge , our results are the first to demonstrate that aminoglycosides can suppress stop codons not only in vitro but also in vivo . furthermore , these results raise the possibility of a novel treatment regimen for muscular dystrophy and other diseases caused by premature stop codon mutations . this treatment could prove effective in up to 15 % of patients with dmd . .;0;0;1;0

a common human skin tumour is caused by activating mutations in beta-catenin.;wnt signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs . in response to this stimulus , cytoplasmic beta-catenin ( encoded by ctnnb1 ) is stabilized , enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the lef / tcf family . one of the target genes for beta-catenin / tcf encodes c-myc , explaining why constitutive activation of the wnt pathway can lead to cancer , particularly in the colon . most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) , a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin , but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations . recently , we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas . given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis , we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations . here , we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour . we found nuclear lef-1 in the dividing tumour cells , providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells . at least 75 % of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment , normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent , ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein . this percentage of ctnnb1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far , and directly implicates beta-catenin / lef misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans . .;0;0;1;1

dual roles of atm in the cellular response to radiation and in cell growth control.;the gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia ( at ) patients , denoted atm , encodes a putative protein or lipid kinase . to elucidate the functions of atm , we disrupted the mouse atm gene through homologous recombination in mice . consistent with cellular defects of at patients , the atm- / - cells are hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation and defective in cell-cycle arrest following radiation , correlating with a defective up-regulation of p53 . in addition , atm- / - mouse thymocytes are more resistant to apoptosis induced by gamma-irradiation than normal thymocytes . atm- / - fibroblasts are inefficient in g1 to s-phase progression following serum stimulation and senesce after only a few passages in culture . they have an increased constitutive level of p21cp1 / waf1 . the atm protein is therefore critical both for cellular responses to ionizing radiation and for normal cell-cycle progression . atm + / - fibroblasts and thymocytes showed intermediately defective responses to irradiation but no growth defect , suggesting that the increased cancer risk of at heterozygotes could be attributable to poor checkpoint function . .;0;0;1;1

rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage.;warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (w-ich) is a severe type of stroke. there is no consensus on the optimal treatment for w-ich. using a mouse model, we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate (pcc) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume. male cd-1 mice were treated with warfarin (2 mg/kg over 24 h), resulting in a mean (+/-s.d.) international normalized ratio of 3.5+/-0.9. first, we showed that an intravenous administration of human pcc rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice. second, a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum. forty-five minutes later, the animals were randomly treated with pcc (100 u/kg) or saline i.v. (n=12 per group). twenty-four hours after hemorrhage induction, hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay. the mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in pcc-treated animals (6.5+/-3.1 microl) compared with saline controls (15.3+/-11.2 microl, p=0.015). in the saline group, 45% of the mice developed large hematomas (i.e., >15 microl). in contrast, such extensive lesions were never found in the pcc group. we provide experimental data suggesting pcc to be an effective acute treatment for w-ich in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume. future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human w-ich.;0;0;1;0
methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia in a 15 year old presenting as near-syncope.;methyldopa is an antihypertensive medication which is available generically and under the trade name aldomet that is widely prescribed in the adult population and infrequently used in children. methyldopa causes an autoimmune hemolytic anemia in a small percentage of patients who take the drug. we report a case of methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia in a 15-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with near-syncope. the boy had been treated with intravenous methyldopa during a trauma admission seven weeks prior to presentation. evaluation revealed a hemoglobin of three grams, 3+ coombs' test with polyspecific anti-human globulin and monospecific igg reagents, and a warm reacting autoantibody. transfusion and corticosteroid therapy resulted in a complete recovery of the patient. emergency physicians treating children must be aware of this syndrome in order to diagnose and treat it correctly. a brief review of autoimmune and drug-induced hemolytic anemias is provided.;0;0;1;0
interactive effects of variations in [na]o and [ca]o on rat atrial spontaneous frequency.;"the effects of varying the extracellular concentrations of na and ca ([na]o and [ca]o) on both, the spontaneous beating and the negative chronotropic action of verapamil, were studied in the isolated rat atria. basal frequency (bf) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 +/- 4 beats/min. in control krebs-ringer containing 137 mm na and 1.35 mm ca (n). it decreased by 16 +/- 3% by lowering [na]o to 78 mm (lna), 23 +/- 2% by lowering simultaneously [na]o to 78 mm and [ca]o to 0.675 mm (lna+lca) and 31 +/- 5% by lowering [na]o to 78 mm plus increasing [ca]o to 3.6 mm (lna+hca). at normal [na]o, decrease (0.675 mm) or increase (3.6 mm) of [ca]o did not modify bf; a reduction of ten times (0.135 mm of normal [ca]o was effective to reduce bf by 40 +/- 13%. all negative chronotropic effects were bf-dependent. dose-dependent bradycardia induced by verapamil was potentiated by lna, lca, and hca. independent but not additive effects of na and ca are shown by decreases in the values of [verapamil]o needed to reduce bf by 30% (ic30) with the following order of inhibitory potency: lna > lca > hca > n, resulting lna+hca similar to lna. the [verapamil]o that arrested atrial beating (ac) was also potentiated with the order lna = lna+lca = lna+hca = lca > hca = n. the results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [na]o than on [ca]o in a range of +/- 50% of their normal concentration. also the enhancement of verapamil effects on atrial beating was more pronounced at lna than at lca.(abstract truncated at 250 words)";1;0;0;0
mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype analyses in cowden disease and bannayan-zonana syndrome, two hamartoma syndromes with germline pten mutation.;"the tumour suppressor gene pten , which maps to 10q23 . 3 and encodes a 403 amino acid dual specificity phosphatase ( protein tyrosine phosphatase ; ptpase ) , was shown recently to play a broad role in human malignancy . somatic pten deletions and mutations were observed in sporadic breast , brain , prostate and kidney cancer cell lines and in several primary tumours such as endometrial carcinomas , malignant melanoma and thyroid tumours . in addition , pten was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes  cowden disease ( cd ; mim 158350 ) and bannayan-zonana ( bzs ) or ruvalcaba-riley-smith syndrome ( mim 153480 ) . constitutive dna from 37 cd families and seven bzs families was screened for germline pten mutations . pten mutations were identified in 30 of 37 ( 81 % ) cd families , including missense and nonsense point mutations , deletions , insertions , a deletion / insertion and splice site mutations . these mutations were scattered over the entire length of pten , with the exception of the first , fourth and last exons . a hot spot for pten mutation in cd was identified in exon 5 that contains the ptpase core motif , with 13 of 30 ( 43 % ) cd mutations identified in this exon . seven of 30 ( 23 % ) were within the core motif , the majority ( five of seven ) of which were missense mutations , possibly pointing to the functional significance of this region . germline pten mutations were identified in four of seven ( 57 % ) bzs families studied . interestingly , none of these mutations was observed in the ptpase core motif . it is also worthy of note that a single nonsense point mutation , r233x , was observed in the germline dna from two unrelated cd families and one bzs family . genotype-phenotype studies were not performed on this small group of bzs families . however , genotype-phenotype analysis inthe group of cd families revealed two possible associations worthy of follow-up in independent analyses . the first was an association noted in the group of cd families with breast disease . a correlation was observed between the presence / absence of a pten mutation and the type of breast involvement ( unaffected versus benign versus malignant ) . specifically and more directly , an association was also observed between the presence of a pten mutation and malignant breast disease . secondly , there appeared to be an interdependent association between mutations upstream and within the ptpase core motif , the core motif containing the majority of missense mutations , and the involvement of all major organ systems ( central nervous system , thyroid , breast , skin and gastrointestinal tract ) . however , these observations would need to be confirmed by studying a larger number of cd families .";0;1;1;1

debrisoquine phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta-2 receptor pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its enantiomers.;the metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine/sparteine type. the two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (em) and poor metabolizers (pm), show different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in ems. we investigated if the latter also applies to the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol. the drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. by using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active s-isomer, were quantitated in ems and pms in terms of ic50 values, representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy. six ems received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. five pms were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher terbutaline dose (0.75 mg) on day 2. blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, r- and s-isomer), and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after metoprolol. in pms, metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%). higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in pms were predictive for higher r-/s-isomer ratios of unchanged drug. there was a difference in metoprolol potency with higher racemic metoprolol ic50 values in pms (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than ems (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, p less than .001).(abstract truncated at 250 words);1;0;1;0

doxorubicin cardiomyopathy-induced inflammation and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin b1 receptor.;clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin (dox) is limited by its cardiotoxic effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis. to elucidate the possible role of the kinin b1 receptor (b1r) during the development of dox cardiomyopathy, we studied b1r knockout mice (b1r(-/-)) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of dox-induced cardiomyopathy. dox control mice showed cardiac dysfunction measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo. this was associated with a reduced activation state of akt, as well as an increased bax/bcl2 ratio in western blots, indicating cardiac apoptosis. furthermore, mrna levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue. in dox b1r(-/-) mice, cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to dox control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as akt activation state. these findings suggest that b1r is detrimental in dox cardiomyopathy in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis. these insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing b1r antagonists for treatment of human dox cardiomyopathy.;1;0;0;0

markedly accelerated catabolism of apolipoprotein a-ii (apoa-ii) and high density lipoproteins containing apoa-ii in classic lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency and fish-eye disease.;"classic ( complete ) lecithin  cholesterol acyltransferase ( lcat ) deficiency and fish-eye disease ( partial lcat deficiency ) are genetic syndromes associated with markedly decreased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol but not with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . we investigated the metabolism of the hdl apolipoproteins ( apo ) apoa-i and apoa-ii in a total of five patients with lcat deficiency , one with classic lcat deficiency and four with fish-eye disease . plasma levels of apoa-ii were decreased to a proportionately greater extent ( 23 % of normal ) than apoa-i ( 30 % of normal ) . in addition , plasma concentrations of hdl particles containing both apoa-i and apoa-ii ( lpa-i  a-ii ) were much lower ( 18 % of normal ) than those of particles containing only apoa-i ( lpa-i ) ( 51 % of normal ) . the metabolic basis for the low levels of apoa-ii and lpa-i  a-ii was investigated in all five patients using both exogenous radiotracer and endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques . the mean plasma residence time of apoa-i was decreased at 2 . 08 + / - 0 . 27 d ( controls 4 . 74 + / - 0 . 65 days ) ; however , the residence time of apoa-ii was even shorter at 1 . 66 + / - 0 . 24 d ( controls 5 . 25 + / - 0 . 61 d ) . in addition , the catabolism of apoa-i in lpa-i  a-ii was substantially faster than that of apoa-i in lpa-i . in summary , genetic syndromes of either complete or partial lcat deficiency result in low levels of hdl through preferential hypercatabolism of apoa-ii and hdl particles containing apoa-ii . because lpa-i has been proposed to be more protective than lpa-i  a-ii against atherosclerosis , this selective effect on the metabolism of lpa-i  a-ii may provide a potential explanation why patients with classic lcat deficiency and fish-eye disease are not at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis despite markedly decreased levels of hdl cholesterol and apoa-i";1;0;0;0

a 71-kilodalton protein is a major product of the duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in brain and other nonmuscle tissues.;the known duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) gene products , the muscle- and brain-type dystrophin isoforms , are 427-kda proteins translated from 14-kilobase ( kb ) mrnas . recently we described a 6 . 5-kb mrna that also is transcribed from the dmd gene . cloning and in vitro transcription and translation of the entire coding region show that the 6 . 5-kb mrna encodes a 70 . 8-kda protein that is a major product of the dmd gene . it contains the c-terminal and the cysteine-rich domains of dystrophin , seven additional amino acids at the n terminus , and some modifications formed by alternative splicing in the c-terminal domain . it lacks the entire large domain of spectrin-like repeats and the actin-binding n-terminal domain of dystrophin . this protein is the major dmd gene product in brain and other nonmuscle tissues but is undetectable in skeletal muscle extracts .;0;0;1;0

are dp71 and dp140 brain dystrophin isoforms related to cognitive impairment in duchenne muscular dystrophy?;molecular study and neuropsychological analysis were performed concurrently on 49 patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) in order to find a molecular explanation for the cognitive impairment observed in most dmd patients . complete analysis of the dystrophin gene was performed to define the localization of deletions and duplications in relation to the different dmd promoters . qualitative analysis of the dp71 transcript and testing for the specific first exon of dp140 were also carried out . neuropsychological analysis assessed verbal and visuospatial intelligence , verbal memory , and reading skills . comparison of molecular and psychometric findings demonstrated that deletions and duplications that were localized in the distal part of the gene seemed to be preferentially associated with cognitive impairment . two altered dp71 transcripts and two deleted dp140 dna sequences were found in four patients with severe cerebral dysfunction . these findings suggest that some sequences located in the distal part of the gene and , in particular , some dmd isoforms expressed in the brain may be related to the cognitive impairment associated with dmd . .;0;0;1;0
the spectrum of rb1 germ-line mutations in hereditary retinoblastoma.;we have searched for germ-line rb1 mutations in 119 patients with hereditary retinoblastoma . previous investigations by southern blot hybridization and pcr fragment-length analysis had revealed mutations in 48 patients . here we report on the analysis of the remaining 71 patients . by applying heteroduplex analysis , nonisotopic sscp , and direct sequencing , we detected germ-line mutations resulting in premature termination codons or disruption of splice signals in 51 ( 72 % ) of the 71 patients . four patients also showed rare sequence variants . no region of the rb1 gene was preferentially involved in single base substitutions . recurrent transitions were observed at most of the 14 codons within the rb1 . no mutation was observed in exons 25-27 , although this region contains two cga codons . this suggests that mutations within the 3-terminal region of the rb1 gene may not be oncogenic . when these data were combined with the results of our previous investigations , mutations were identified in a total of 99 ( 83 % ) of 119 patients . the spectrum comprises 15 % large deletions , 26 % small length alterations , and 42 % base substitutions . no correlation between the location of frameshift or nonsense mutations and phenotypic features , including age at diagnosis , the number of tumor foci , and manifestation of nonocular tumors was observed . .;0;0;0;1

the normal huntington disease (hd) allele, or a closely linked gene, influences age at onset of hd.;we evaluated the hypothesis that huntington disease ( hd ) is influenced by the normal hd allele by comparing transmission patterns of genetically linked markers at the d4s10 locus in the normal parent against age at onset in the affected offspring . analysis of information from 21 sibships in 14 kindreds showed a significant tendency for sibs who have similar onset ages to share the same d4s10 allele from the normal parent . affected sibs who inherited different d4s10 alleles from the normal parent tended to have more variable ages at onset . these findings suggest that the expression of hd is modulated by the normal hd allele or by a closely linked locus . .;0;0;1;0

initial potassium loss and hypokalaemia during chlorthalidone administration in patients with essential hypertension: the influence of dietary sodium restriction.;"to investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic, metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment. chlorthalidone (50 mg daily) was given for 14 days. six patients received a normal-sodium diet and four a low-sodium (17 mmol/day) diet. all patients had a normal initial total body potassium (40k). the electrolyte balances, weight, bromide space, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone secretion rate were measured. in both groups a potassium deficit developed, with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment. in the normal-sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9, after which some potassium was regained; in the low-sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13. the normal-sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels; in the low-sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elevated. it is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic-induced potassium loss, presumably by an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion.";1;1;0;0

sorafenib-induced acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery spasm.;a 65-year-old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma was admitted due to continuing chest pain at rest. two weeks before his admission, sorafenib had been started. he was diagnosed with non-st-elevation myocardial infarction by laboratory data and electrocardiogram. enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed subendocardial infarction. however, there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography. coronary artery spasm was induced by a provocative test. cessation of sorafenib and administration of ca-channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms, but relapse occurred after resumption of sorafenib. addition of oral nicorandil reduced his symptoms and maintained stable angina status. we report the first case of sorafenib-induced coronary artery spasm. sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival. on the other hand, the rho/rock pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm. our report may show an adverse effect on the rho/rock pathway by sorafenib use.;1;1;1;1

phenotypic characterization of individuals with 30-40 cag repeats in the huntington disease (hd) gene reveals hd cases with 36 repeats and apparently normal elderly individuals with 36-39 repeats.;abnormal cag expansions in the it-15 gene are associated with huntington disease ( hd ) . in the diagnostic setting it is necessary to define the limits of the cag size ranges on normal and hd-associated chromosomes . most large analyses that defined the limits of the normal and pathological size ranges employed pcr assays , which included the cag repeats and a ccg repeat tract that was thought to be invariant . many of these experiments found an overlap between the normal and disease size ranges . subsequent findings that the ccg repeats vary by 8 trinucleotide lengths suggested that the limits of the normal and disease size ranges should be reevaluated with assays that exclude the ccg polymorphism . since patients with between 30 and 40 repeats are rare , a consortium was assembled to collect such individuals . all 178 samples were reanalyzed in cambridge by using assays specific for the cag repeats . we have optimized methods for reliable sizing of cag repeats and show cases that demonstrate the dangers of using pcr assays that include both the cag and ccg polymorphisms . seven hd patients had 36 repeats , which confirms that this allele is associated with disease . individuals without apparent symptoms or signs of hd were found at 36 repeats ( aged 74 , 78 , 79 , and 87 years ) , 37 repeats ( aged 69 years ) , 38 repeats ( aged 69 and 90 years ) , and 39 repeats ( aged 67 , 90 , and 95 years ) . the detailed case histories of an exceptional case from this series will be presented  a 95-year-old man with 39 repeats who did not have classical features of hd . the apparently healthy survival into old age of some individuals with 36-39 repeats suggests that the hd mutation may not always be fully penetrant . .;0;0;1;0

high-dose tranexamic acid is associated with nonischemic clinical seizures in cardiac surgical patients.;background: in 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. these events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose tranexamic acid (txa) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. the purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between txa usage and seizures after cardiac surgery. methods: an in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures. electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies. results: twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients. all patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities. all 24 patients with seizures received high doses of txa intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures. all but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass. no evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their seizures was apparent. conclusion: our results suggest that use of high-dose txa in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients.;1;0;1;0

associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health, physical abilities and cognitive function: a non-randomised clinical study in the elderly.;objective: to describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs (bzds/rds) and health, functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly. methods: a non-randomised clinical study of patients aged > or =65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month. 164 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation [sd] 81.6 +/- 6.8 years) were admitted. of these, nearly half (n = 78) had used bzds/rds before admission, and the remainder (n = 86) were non-users. cognitive ability was assessed by the mini-mental state examination (mmse). patients scoring > or =20 mmse sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission. data on use of bzds/rds before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records. health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between bzd/rd users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. the residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed. results: the mean +/- sd duration of bzd/rd use was 7 +/- 7 years (range 1-31). two or three bzds/rds were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20). long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the cns, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia. after adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of bzds/rds was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the mmse. however, use of bzds/rds was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. use of bzds/rds tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission. a higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower mmse sum score after adjustment for confounding variables. conclusions: long-term use and concomitant use of more than one bzd/rd were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses. long-term use was associated with daytime and night-time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs.;0;0;1;0

coexistence of cerebral venous sinus and internal carotid artery thrombosis associated with exogenous sex hormones. a case report.;a forty-six year-old premenopausal woman developed headache, nausea and vomiting, left hemiparesis and seizure two days after parenteral use of progesterone and estradiol. diabetes mellitus (dm) was found during admission. computed tomography showed a hemorrhagic infarct in the right frontal lobe and increased density in the superior sagittal sinus (sss). left carotid angiography found occlusion of the left internal carotid artery (ica). right carotid angiograms failed to show the sss and inferior sagittal sinus, suggestive of venous sinus thrombosis. coexistence of the cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion has been described infrequently. in this case, the authors postulate that the use of estradiol and progesterone and the underlying dm increased vascular thrombogenicity, which provided a common denominator for thrombosis of both the ica and the venous sinus.;1;0;1;0
cdna microarrays detect activation of a myogenic transcription program by the pax3-fkhr fusion oncogene.;"alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of striated muscle characterized in 60 % of cases by a t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) . this results in the fusion of pax3 , a developmental transcription factor required for limb myogenesis , with fkhr , a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors . the resultant pax3-fkhr gene possesses transforming properties ; however , the effects of this chimeric oncogene on gene expression are largely unknown . to investigate the actions of these transcription factors , both pax3 and pax3-fkhr were introduced into nih 3t3 cells , and the resultant gene expression changes were analyzed with a murine cdna microarray containing 2 , 225 elements . we found that pax3-fkhr but not pax3 activated a myogenic transcription program including the induction of transcription factors myod , myogenin , six1 , and slug as well as a battery of genes involved in several aspects of muscle function . notable among this group were the growth factor gene igf2 and its binding protein igfbp5 . relevance of this model was suggested by verification that three of these genes ( igfbp5 , hsix1 , and slug ) were also expressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines . this study utilizes cdna microarrays to elucidate the pattern of gene expression induced by an oncogenic transcription factor and demonstrates the profound myogenic properties of pax3-fkhr in nih 3t3 cells . .";0;0;0;1

salicylate nephropathy in the gunn rat: potential role of prostaglandins.;"we examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the development of analgesic nephropathy in the gunn strain of rat. the homozygous gunn rats have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuronyl transferase, leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla. these rats are also highly susceptible to develop papillary necrosis with analgesic administration. we used homozygous (jj) and phenotypically normal heterozygous (jj) animals. four groups of rats (n = 7) were studied: jj and jj rats treated either with aspirin 300 mg/kg every other day or sham-treated. after one week, slices of cortex, outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and prostaglandin synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay. the other kidney was examined histologically. a marked corticomedullary gradient of prostaglandin synthesis was observed in all groups. pge2 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla, but not cortex or inner medulla, of jj (38 +/- 6 ng/mg prot) than jj rats (15 +/- 3) (p less than 0.01). aspirin treatment reduced pge2 synthesis in all regions, but outer medullary pge2 remained higher in jj (18 +/- 3) than jj rats (9 +/- 2) (p less than 0.05). pgf2 alpha was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without aspirin administration (p less than 0.05). the changes in renal prostaglandin synthesis were accompanied by evidence of renal damage in aspirin-treated jj but not jj rats as evidenced by: increased incidence and severity of hematuria (p less than 0.01); increased serum creatinine (p less than 0.05); and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions (p less than 0.005 compared to either sham-treated jj or aspirin-treated jj). these results suggest that enhanced prostaglandin synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity, and that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function.";0;1;0;0

genetic linkage map of six polymorphic dna markers around the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis on chromosome 5.;a genetic linkage map of six polymorphic dna markers close to the gene ( apc ) for familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) on chromosome 5q is reported . one hundred fifty-five typed members of nine fap kindred provided more than 90 meioses for linkage analysis . a number of crucial recombination events have been identified which are informative at three or more loci , allowing confident ordering of parts of the map . there was no evidence of genetic heterogeneity , with all families showing linkage of at least one chromosome 5 marker to the gene . recombination data and two-point linkage analysis support a locus order of centromere-pi 227-c11p11-ecb27-l5 . 62-apc-ef5 62-apc-ef5 . 44-yn5 44-yn5 . 48-telomer e , although ef5 . 44 could lie in the interval l5 . 62-apc or ecb27-l5 . 62 . no recombinants were identified between apc and either ef5 . 44 or yn5 . 48 , but published deletion mapping in colorectal carcinomas and linkage analysis in fap suggest that yn5 . 48 is 1-3 cm from apc . the present study suggests that yn5 . 48 and l5 . 62 delineate a small region of chromosome 5 within which the ef5 . 44 locus lies very close to the apc gene . these data not only allow use of flanking markers for presymptomatic diagnosis of fap but also provide a high-density map of the region for isolation of the apc gene itself and for further assessment of the role of chromosome 5 deletions in the biology of sporadic colorectal cancer .;0;0;0;1
prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (octreotide) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in chinese acromegalic patients.;this article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months. during treatment with octreotide, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had gallstones, and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery. in all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100-micrograms injection. in 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy. after withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. in 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients (3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained depressed in 3 (2 of whom had stones present at 6 months). our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, gallstones, and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in chinese acromegalic patients. it is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long-term octreotide therapy of acromegalic patients.;0;0;1;0
cardiotoxic and possible leukemogenic effects of adriamycin in nonhuman primates.;"10 monkeys (macaques) received adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg/m2 (1 mg/kg). 8 of the 10 monkeys developed congestive heart failure at an average cumulative adriamycin dose (310 mg/m2) well below that considered the safe upper limit (550 mg/m2) in man. histologically, the myocardial lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. 1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute myeloblastic leukemia after receiving 324 mg/m2 of adriamycin; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug. our results suggest that adriamycin is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man, and that leukemia may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug.";1;0;0;1

brca1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex.;germ-line mutations in the brca1 tumor-suppressor gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer . brca1 contains a carboxyl-terminal domain ( brct ) that is shared with several other proteins involved in maintaining genome integrity . in an effort to understand the function of brca1 , we sought to isolate proteins that interact with the brct domain . purified brct polypeptide was used as a probe to screen a human placenta cdna expression library by far western analysis . here we report that brca1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with the rb-binding proteins , rbap46 and rbap48 , as well as with rb . moreover , the brct domain associates with the histone deacetylases hdac1 and hdac2 . these results demonstrate that brca1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex , and therefore may explain the involvement of brca1 in multiple processes such as transcription , dna repair , and recombination . .;0;0;0;1

restriction of ocular fundus lesions to a specific subgroup of apc mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli patients.;in humans , alteration of the tumor suppressor gene , apc , causes adenomatous polyposis coli , a condition causing predisposition to colorectal cancer . the syndrome inconsistently associates characteristic patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium ( chrpe ) . ocular examination revealed that patients expressing chrpe tend to cluster within specific families . the exact apc mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients . in all cases these mutations were predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein . the extent of chrpe was found to be dependent on the position of the mutation along the coding sequence . chrpe lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9 , but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon . thus , the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of apc mutations . .;0;0;0;1

dynamic response of blood vessel in acute renal failure.;in this study we postulated that during acute renal failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels. the new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered, but also dynamics of this response, was used in this paper. our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals. the beneficial effects of vitamin c administration to gentamicin-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium. the pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in gentamicin-treated animals (8.07 +/- 1.7 s vs. 5.64 +/- 0.18 s). vitamin c administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values. the pressure dynamic properties, quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic, confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals and beneficial effects of vitamin c administration.;0;1;0;0

morphine-induced seizures in newborn infants.;two neonates suffered from generalized seizures during the course of intravenous morphine sulfate for post-operative analgesia. they received morphine in doses of 32 micrograms/kg/hr and 40 micrograms/kg/hr larger than a group of 10 neonates who received 6-24 micrograms/kg/hr and had no seizures. plasma concentrations of morphine in these neonates was excessive (60 and 90 mg/ml). other known reasons for seizures were ruled out and the convulsions stopped a few hours after cessation of morphine and did not reoccur in the subsequent 8 months. it is suggested that post-operative intravenous morphine should not exceed 20 micrograms/kg/ml in neonates.;0;0;1;0

glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks of migraine without aura in sufferers of migraine with aura.;migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase, thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception. in recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide (no) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura. in order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (gtn) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura. the specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and/or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced. fourteen healthy subjects served as controls. aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject. headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after gtn infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). in the controls, the gtn-induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. at this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the international headache society. the results therefore suggest that no is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura. since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate no in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura.;0;0;1;0

transient neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia: a lower incidence with prilocaine and bupivacaine than with lidocaine.;"background: recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms (tnss) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine. however, identification of a short-acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal. prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine. accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of tnss. methods: ninety patients classified as american society of anesthesiologists physical status i or ii who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2% lidocaine in 7.5% glucose, 2% prilocaine in 7.5% glucose, or 0.5% bupivacaine in 7.5% glucose. all solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy. details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted. in the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for tnss by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure. results: nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced tnss, 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine (p = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had tnss. times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine (150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min, respectively) but prolonged after bupivacaine (200 and 299 min, respectively; p < 0.05). conclusions: prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of tnss.";0;0;1;0
optimising stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation.;atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as vitamin k antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events, but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests. the active-w (atrial fibrillation clopidogrel trial with irbesartan for prevention of vascular events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. idraparinux, a factor xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling. preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion. finally, percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high-risk patients.;1;1;0;0

prolongation of the qt interval related to cisapride-diltiazem interaction.;cisapride, a cytochrome p450 3a4 (cyp3a4) substrate, is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders. prolongation of qt interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other cyp3a4 inhibitors. a possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on cyp3a4, for hypertension. the patient was in near syncope and had qt-interval prolongation. after discontinuing cisapride, the qt interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur. we suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of cyp3a4, including diltiazem.;1;0;1;0
tight linkage between myotonic dystrophy and apolipoprotein e genes revealed with allele-specific oligonucleotides.;in 16 families with myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) a novel approach based on use of allele-specific oligonucleotides has been employed to study the linkage relationship between the apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) gene and dm . synthetic oligonucleotides , designed to discriminate between apoe alleles epsilon 3 and epsilon 4 , enabled us to distinguish heterozygous carriers in a hybridization assay . in a subset of families , the relevant segment of the apoe gene was enzymatically amplified to increase the sensitivity of the method . for dm and apoe , a maximum lod score ( zmax of 7 . 47 was obtained at a recombination frequency ( theta ) of 0 . 047 ( male theta = female theta ) . no recombination ( maximum lod score of 5 . 61 at theta = 0 . 0 ) was found between apoe and the apolipoprotein cii ( apoc2 ) gene . these results suggest that , in addition to apoc2 , apoe is a useful marker for presymptomatic dm diagnosis .;0;0;1;0

corneal ulcers associated with aerosolized crack cocaine use.;purpose: we report 4 cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse. the pathogenesis of these ulcers and management of these patients are also reviewed. methods: review of all cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse seen at our institution from july 2006 to december 2006. results: four patients with corneal ulcers associated with crack cocaine use were reviewed. all corneal ulcers were cultured, and the patients were admitted to the hospital for intensive topical antibiotic treatment. each patient received comprehensive health care, including medical and substance abuse consultations. streptococcal organisms were found in 3 cases and capnocytophaga and brevibacterium casei in 1 patient. the infections responded to antibiotic treatment. two patients needed a lateral tarsorrhaphy for persistent epithelial defects. conclusions: aerosolized crack cocaine use can be associated with the development of corneal ulcers. drug abuse provides additional challenges for management. not only treatment of their infections but also the overall poor health of the patients and increased risk of noncompliance need to be addressed. comprehensive care may provide the patient the opportunity to discontinue their substance abuse, improve their overall health, and prevent future corneal complications.;0;0;1;0
molecular analysis in familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus: early diagnosis of an asymptomatic carrier.;familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( fndi ) is an inherited deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin ( avp ) and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait . in the present study we have analyzed the avp-neurophysin ii ( avp-npii ) gene in a spanish kindred . studies were performed on seven members ( four clinically affected ) of the family . patients were diagnosed at the hospital universitario gregorio maranon ( madrid , spain ) . the entire coding region of the avp-npii gene of all family members was amplified by pcr and sequenced . all affected individuals presented a missense mutation ( g1757-- > a ) that replaces glycine at position 23 with arginine within the npii domain . the substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and was present in heterozygosis . additionally , one of the asymptomatic relatives ( a girl 8 months old at the time of study ) was identified as carrier of the same mutation and developed the disease 3 months later . the alteration found in the second exon of the gene in this family seems to be responsible for the disease , as all individuals harboring the mutation had been previously diagnosed or have eventually developed fndi . identification of the molecular defect underlying fndi in affected families is a powerful tool for early asymptomatic diagnosis in infants . .;0;0;1;0

acute confusion induced by a high-dose infusion of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid.;a 61-year-old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum, etoposide, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (2,250 mg/m2/24 hours) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma. he developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion, disorientation and irritability, and then lapsed into a deep coma, lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion. this complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid, which were then the only drugs given. because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition, neurotoxicity due to high-dose 5-fluorouracil was highly suspected. the pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate, thiamine deficiency, or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency. high-dose 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancers. it is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication.;0;0;1;1
pubertal exposure to bisphenol a increases anxiety-like behavior and decreases acetylcholinesterase activity of hippocampus in adult male mice.;the negative effects of bisphenol a (bpa) on neurodevelopment and behaviors have been well established. acetylcholinesterase (ache) is a regulatory enzyme which is involved in anxiety-like behavior. this study investigated behavioral phenotypes and ache activity in male mice following bpa exposure during puberty. on postnatal day (pnd) 35, male mice were exposed to 50mg bpa/kg diet per day for a period of 35 days. on pnd71, a behavioral assay was performed using the elevated plus maze (epm) and the light/dark test. in addition, ache activity was measured in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and hippocampus. results from our behavioral phenotyping indicated that anxiety-like behavior was increased in mice exposed to bpa. ache activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mice with bpa compared to control mice, whereas no difference was found in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum. our findings showed that pubertal bpa exposure increased anxiety-like behavior, which may be associated with decreased ache activity of the hippocampus in adult male mice. further studies are necessary to investigate the cholinergic signaling of the hippocampus in pbe induced anxiety-like behaviors.;0;0;1;0
hepatocellular carcinoma in fanconi's anemia treated with androgen and corticosteroid.;the case of an 11-year-old boy is reported who was known to have fanconi's anemia for 3 years and was treated with androgens, corticosteroids and transfusions. two weeks before his death he was readmitted because of aplastic crisis with septicemia and marked abnormalities in liver function and died of hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia. at autopsy peliosis and multiple hepatic tumors were found which histologically proved to be well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. this case contributes to the previous observations that non-metastasizing hepatic neoplasms and peliosis can develop in patients with androgen- and corticosteroid-treated fanconi's anemia.;0;1;1;1

spironolactone-induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure.;background: a previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia (2%) and renal insufficiency (0%). because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. we therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. methods: we performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (k(+) >5.0 meq/l) or renal insufficiency (cr >or=2.5 mg/dl), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared. results: sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls. conclusions: spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously. this difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta-blockers.;1;1;0;0

methamphetamine causes alterations in the map kinase-related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased aggressiveness.;aggressive behaviors have been reported in patients who suffer from some psychiatric disorders, and are common in methamphetamine (meth) abusers. herein, we report that multiple (but not single) injections of meth significantly increased aggressiveness in male cd-1 mice. this increase in aggressiveness was not secondary to meth-induced hyperactivity. analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and western blotting revealed differential changes in map kinase-related pathways after multiple and single meth injections. there were statistically significant (p<0.05) decreases in mek1, erk2p, gsk3alpha, 14-3-3e, and mek7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of meth. mek1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of meth, but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of meth. in the frontal cortex, there was a statistically significant decrease in gsk3alpha after multiple (but not single) injections of meth. these findings suggest that alterations in map kinase-related pathways in the prefronto-striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of aggressive behaviors in mice.;0;0;1;0
cerebellar sensory processing alterations impact motor cortical plasticity in parkinson's disease: clues from dyskinetic patients.;the plasticity of primary motor cortex (m1) in patients with parkinson's disease (pd) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (lids) is severely impaired. we recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of m1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation (pas). this study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor m1 plasticity in 16 patients with lids could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation. this was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity, indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of m1 plasticity. the benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on lids is known. to explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of m1, we conducted an additional study looking at changes in lids and pas-induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral, real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation. only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of m1. these results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function, occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it, may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of m1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements.;0;0;1;0

analysis of deletions in dna from patients with becker and duchenne muscular dystrophy.;duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) is an x-linked recessive genetic disorder for which the biochemical defect is as yet unknown . recently , two cloned segments of human x-chromosome dna have been described which detect structural alterations within or near the genetic locus responsible for the disorder . both of these cloned segments were described as tightly linked to the locus and were capable of detecting deletions in the dna of boys affected with dmd . in an attempt to determine more precisely the occurrence of these deletions within a large population of dmd patients and the accuracy of one of the segments , dxs164 ( pert87 ) , in determining the inheritance of the dmd x chromosome , the subclones 1 , 8 and 15 were made available to many investigators throughout the world . here we describe the combined results of more than 20 research laboratories with respect to the occurrence of deletions at the dxs164 locus in dna samples isolated from patients with dmd and becker muscular dystrophy ( bmd ) . the results indicate that the dxs164 locus apparently recombines with dmd 5 % of the time , but is probably located between independent sites of mutation which yield dmd . the breakpoints of some deletions are delineated within the dxs164 locus , and it is evident that the deletions at the dmd locus are frequent and extremely large . .;0;0;1;0

an arylsulfatase a (arsa) missense mutation (t274m) causing late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy.;"metachromatic leukodystrophy ( mld ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase a ( arsa ; ec 3 . 1 1 . 6 6 . 8 ) . the 8 arsa exons and adjacent intron boundaries from a patient with late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy were polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) amplified in seven discrete reactions . amplified arsa exons were analysed for the presence of sequence alterations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis , followed by direct sequencing of pcr products . the patient was found to be homozygous for a c-- > t transition in exon iv that results in the substitution of a highly conserved threonine residue at amino acid 274 with a methionine ( t274m ) . analysis of a further 29 mld patients revealed the presence of five additional homozygotes for t274m . all 6 t274m homozygotes ( representing four families ) were of lebanese descent , and all were known to be the result of consanguineous marriages . the altered amino acid is rigidly conserved among 10 sulfatases from escherichia coli to humans ; therefore , it is most likely that the resultant mutant protein will have little or no enzyme activity . this is consistent with the very low arsa activity measured in these patients and their uniformly severe clinical presentation";0;0;1;0
aconitine-induced ca2+ overload causes arrhythmia and triggers apoptosis through p38 mapk signaling pathway in rats.;aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants. emerging evidence indicates that voltage-dependent na(+) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine. however, no reports are available on the role of ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning. in this study, we explored the importance of pathological ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo. we found that ca(2+) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats. to investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (nrvms), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of nrvms and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats. the results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced nrvms viability dose-dependently. to confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp-biotin nick end labeling assay. the results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time-dependently. the expression analysis of ca(2+) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted ca(2+) overload through the expression regulation of ca(2+) handling proteins. the expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 expression was downregulated. furthermore, increased phosphorylation of mapk family members, especially the p-p38/p38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues. hence, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates ca(2+) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.;1;0;1;0

incidence of neoplasms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to different treatment regimens.;immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. the drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). there is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-hodgkin's lymphoma. cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. there have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased. data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly alkylating agents, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening complications.;0;0;1;1

homozygous presence of the crossover (fusion gene) mutation identified in a type ii gaucher disease fetus: is this analogous to the gaucher knock-out mouse model?;gaucher disease ( gd ) is an inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase ( ec 3 . 1 . 2 . 45 , gene symbol gba ) . in type i gd , the cns is not involved ( nonneuronopathic ) , whereas in type ii gd ( acute neuronopathic ) cns involvement is early and rapidly progressive , while in type iii gd ( subacute neuronopathic ) cns involvement occurs later and is slowly progressive . the t6433c ( l444p ) substitution is prevalent in type gd ii . it may occur alone as a single base-pair mutation but often is found as part of a complex allele containing additional gba nucleotide substitutions , g6468c ( a456p ) and g6482c ( v460v ) , without ( recncii ) or with ( rectl ) g5957c ( d409h ) . this complex allele is presumed to have formed by recombination ( crossover , fusion ) of the structural gene with the pseudogene , which contains the mutated sequences . two complex alleles have never been demonstrated to coexist in any individual . we devised a selective pcr method for the specific amplification of the normal and / or fusion gene . using this procedure we demonstrated the fusion gene in homozygous form for the first time , in a macedonian / ashkenazi jewish gd type ii fetus . both parents were carriers of the recombination . this was confirmed by direct sequence analysis . a previous conceptus in this family was stillborn at 36 weeks , with features of severe type ii gd . neonates showing a severe clinical phenotype , analogous to the early neonatal lethal disease occurring in mice homozygous for a null allele produced by targeted disruption of gba , have been described elsewhere , but the specific mutations in these cases have not yet been characterized .

receptor mechanisms of nicotine-induced locomotor hyperactivity in chronic nicotine-treated rats.;rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine (1.5 mg/kg per day) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an alzet osmotic mini-pump which continuously released saline or nicotine for 1, 5 and 14 days. at the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of l-[3h]nicotine and [3h]spiperone binding sites in the striatum. we observed no changes in nicotine-induced locomotor response, striatal l-[3h]nicotine and [3h]spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day. in rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of l-[3h]nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine (da) level in the striatum. the number of striatal [3h]spiperone binding sites was not affected. in animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days, the nicotine-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated. however, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3h]spiperone binding sites, whereas the number of striatal l-[3h]nicotine binding sites and the striatal da level were normal. these results suggest that chronic nicotine-treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and da concentration, followed by inducing da receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.;0;0;1;0

increased coronary heart disease in japanese-american men with mutation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene despite increased hdl levels.;"plasma high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) levels are strongly genetically determined and show a general inverse relationship with coronary heart disease ( chd ) . the cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( cetp ) mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from hdl to other lipoproteins and is a key participant in the reverse transport of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver . a high prevalence of two different cetp gene mutations ( d442g , 5 . 1 % ; intron 14g  a , 0 . 5 % ) , was found in 3 , 469 men of japanese ancestry in the honolulu heart program and mutations were associated with decreased cetp ( -35 % ) and increased hdl chol levels ( + 10 % for d442g ) . however , the overall prevalence of definite chd was 21 % in men with mutations and 16 % in men without mutations . the relative risk ( rr ) of chd was 1 . 43 in men with mutations ( p chd risk factors , the rr was 1 . 55 ( p = . 02 ) ; after additional adjustment for hdl levels , the rr was 1 . 68 ( p = . 008 ) . similar rr values were obtained for the d442g mutation alone . increased chd in men with mutations was primarily observed for hdl chol 41-60 mg / dl ; for hdl chol > 60 mg / dl men with and without mutations had low chd prevalence . thus , genetic cetp deficiency appears to be an independent risk factor for chd , primarily due to increased chd prevalence in men with the d442g mutation and hdl cholesterol between 41 and 60 mg / dl . the findings suggest that both hdl concentration and the dynamics of cholesterol transport through hdl ( i . e. , reverse cholesterol transport ) determine the anti-atherogenicity of the hdl fraction .";1;1;0;0
cause of death among patients with parkinson's disease: a rare mortality due to cerebral haemorrhage.;causes of death, with special reference to cerebral haemorrhage, among 240 patients with pathologically verified parkinson's disease were investigated using the annuals of the pathological autopsy cases in japan from 1981 to 1985. the leading causes of death were pneumonia and bronchitis (44.1%), malignant neoplasms (11.6%), heart diseases (4.1%), cerebral infarction (3.7%) and septicaemia (3.3%). cerebral haemorrhage was the 11th most frequent cause of death, accounting for only 0.8% of deaths among the patients, whereas it was the 5th most common cause of death among the japanese general population in 1985. the low incidence of cerebral haemorrhage as a cause of death in patients with parkinson's disease may reflect the hypotensive effect of levodopa and a hypotensive mechanism due to reduced noradrenaline levels in the parkinsonian brain.;1;1;1;1

d-penicillamine in the treatment of localized scleroderma.;"localized scleroderma has no recognized internal organ involvement but may be disfiguring and disabling when the cutaneous lesions are extensive or affect children. there is no accepted or proven treatment for localized scleroderma. case reports of 11 patients with severe, extensive localized scleroderma who were treated with d-penicillamine are summarized in this article. this drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 (64%) of 11 patients. improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients, skin softening in 5, and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children. joint stiffness and contractures also improved. the dose of d-penicillamine associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg/kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months. d-penicillamine caused nephrotic syndrome in 1 patient and milder reversible proteinuria in 3 other patients; none developed renal insufficiency. these data suggest that d-penicillamine may be effective in severe cases of localized scleroderma.";0;1;0;0

a phase ii trial of cisplatin plus wr-2721 (amifostine) for metastatic breast carcinoma: an eastern cooperative oncology group study (e8188).;background: cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second- or third-line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma. older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8% when 60-120 mg/m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3-4 weeks. although a dose-response effect has been observed with cisplatin, the dose-limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin (e.g., nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma. wr-2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war. amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy. early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuropathy were reduced. methods: a phase ii study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one, but not more than one, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. patients received amifostine, 910 mg/m2 intravenously over 15 minutes. after completion of the amifostine infusion, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 was administered over 30 minutes. intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin. treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression. results: forty-four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 (16%) were ineligible. a median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients. six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16%. most patients (57%) stopped treatment because of disease progression. neurologic toxicity was reported in 52% of patients. seven different life-threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment. conclusions: the combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16%. neither a tumor-protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this trial.;0;1;1;1
disruption of splicing regulated by a cug-binding protein in myotonic dystrophy.;myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) is caused by a ctg expansion in the 3 untranslated region of the dm gene . one model of dm pathogenesis suggests that rnas from the expanded allele create a gain-of-function mutation by the inappropriate binding of proteins to the cug repeats . data presented here indicate that the conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein , cug-binding protein ( cug-bp ) , may mediate the trans-dominant effect of the rna . cug-bp was found to bind to the human cardiac troponin t ( ctnt ) pre-messenger rna and regulate its alternative splicing . splicing of ctnt was disrupted in dm striated muscle and in normal cells expressing transcripts that contain cug repeats . altered expression of genes regulated posttranscriptionally by cug-bp therefore may contribute to dm pathogenesis . .;0;0;1;0

effect of intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus glucagon on dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.;study objective: to determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing with technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography imaging and st-segment monitoring, and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol's effects. design: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. setting: community hospital. patients: twenty-two patients with known reversible perfusion defects. intervention: patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol. before dobutamine was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg. metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg. measurements and main results: metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control. metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control. summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control. no significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol-glucagon. conclusion: during dobutamine stress testing, metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia. glucagon 1 mg, although somewhat effective, does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically.;1;0;0;0
the haemodynamic effects of propofol in combination with ephedrine in elderly patients (asa groups 3 and 4).;the marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of propofol are disadvantages in frail elderly patients. we investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of ephedrine to propofol in order to obtund the hypotensive response. the haemodynamic effects of adding 15, 20 or 25 mg of ephedrine to 200 mg of propofol were compared to control in 40 asa 3/4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito-urinary surgery. the addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study. however, marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients. due to the risk of this tachycardia inducing myocardial ischemia, we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the ephedrine/propofol/mixtures studied.;1;0;0;0

utility of troponin i in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.;baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities and market elevations not associated with myocardial necrosis make accurate diagnosis of myocardial infarction (mi) difficult in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. troponin sampling may offer greater diagnostic utility in these patients. objective: to assess outcomes based on troponin positivity in patients with cocaine chest pain admitted for exclusion of mi. methods: outcomes were examined in patients admitted for possible mi after cocaine use. all patients underwent a rapid rule-in protocol that included serial sampling of creatine kinase (ck), ck-mb, and cardiac troponin i (ctni) over eight hours. outcomes included ck-mb mi (ck-mb >or= 8 ng/ml with a relative index [(ck-mb x 100)/total ck] >or= 4, cardiac death, and significant coronary disease (>or=50%). results: of the 246 admitted patients, 34 (14%) met ck-mb criteria for mi and 38 (16%) had ctni elevations. angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were ctni-positive, with significant disease present in 25 (86%). three of the four patients without significant disease who had ctni elevations met ck-mb criteria for mi, and the other had a peak ck-mb level of 13 ng/ml. sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for predicting cardiac death or significant disease were high for both ck-mb mi and ctni and were not significantly different. conclusions: most patients with ctni elevations meet ck-mb criteria for mi, as well as have a high incidence of underlying significant disease. troponin appears to have an equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared with ck-mb for diagnosing necrosis in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain and suspected mi.;1;0;0;0

effects of long-term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats.;it has been shown that bromocriptine-induced tachycardia, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central dopamine d2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day isoproterenol pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart. this study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats. isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate. in control rats, intravenous bromocriptine (150 microg/kg) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia. bromocriptine-induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment, while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. domperidone (0.5 mg/kg). neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment. in isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol-pretreated rats, the isoproterenol-induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced, compared with saline-pretreated rats (the ec50 of the isoproterenol-induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22-fold). these results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine-induced tachycardia to bradycardia, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart. they suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine d2 receptors.;1;1;0;0

epithelial sodium channel (enac) subunit mrna and protein expression in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome.;in experimental nephrotic syndrome, urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease. the molecular mechanism(s) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated. the rate-limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel (enac). we examined the abundance of enac subunit mrnas and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside (pan)-induced nephrotic syndrome. the time courses of urinary sodium excretion, plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male sprague-dawley rats treated with a single dose of either pan or vehicle. the relative amounts of alphaenac, betaenac and gammaenac mrnas were determined in kidneys from these rats by real-time quantitative taqman pcr, and the amounts of proteins by western blot. the kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously. sodium retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after pan injection. a significant up-regulation of alphaenac and betaenac mrna abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3. conversely, down-regulation of alphaenac, betaenac and gammaenac mrna expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations, and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values. the amounts of alphaenac, betaenac and gammaenac proteins were not increased during pan-induced sodium retention. in conclusion, enac mrna expression, especially alphaenac, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of pan-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3.;0;1;0;0

the ews gene, involved in ewing family of tumors, malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors, codes for an rna binding protein with novel regulatory domains.;the ews gene , which maps to band q12 of human chromosome 22 , is involved in a wide variety of human solid tumors including ewing sarcoma , related primitive neuroectodermal tumors , malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors . in these tumors , the ews is fused to genes encoding transcriptional activators / repressors , like fli-1 or erg or atf 1 or wt1 . to better understand the function of the ews protein , we cloned the ews cdna . sequence analysis of this cdna revealed differential splicing involving two exons encoding 72 amino acids . both alternatively spliced transcripts , ews and ews-b , are expressed in a variety of cells . because ews proteins contain putative conserved rna binding motifs , we studied the rna binding properties of the ews protein . the ews-b protein binds to rna in vitro and , specifically , to poly g and poly u . the rna binding activity was localized to the carboxy terminal 86 amino acids , which constitute rgg box . thus the amino terminal domain of ews ( ntd-ews ) , which is involved in chromosome translocation may regulate the specificity of rna binding activity of ews . an ews-erg chimeric protein , which is found in ewings sarcoma cells , functions as a transcriptional activator . mutational analysis of ews-erg chimeric protein revealed that ntd-ews functions as a regulatory domain for the transcriptional activation properties of ews-erg chimeric protein . .;0;0;1;1

autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus associated with a missense mutation encoding gly23-->val in neurophysin ii.;autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( adndi ) is an inherited disease caused by progressive degeneration of the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus leading to decreased ability to produce the hormone arginine vasopressin ( avp ) . affected individuals are not symptomatic at birth , but usually develop diabetes insipidus at 1-6 yr of age . the genetic locus of the disease is the avp-neurophysin ii ( npii ) gene , and mutations that cause adndi have been found in both the signal peptide of the prepro-avp-npii precursor and within npii itself . an affected girl who presented at 9 months of age and her similarly affected younger brother and father were all found to have a novel missense mutation ( g1758-- > t ) encoding the amino acid substitution gly23-- > val within npii . the mutation was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis . a t1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the fathers pituitary gland demonstrates an attenuated posterior pituitary bright spot . this mutation may be valuable for developing models of dominantly inherited neurodegeneration , as the early age of onset of symptoms suggests that this mutation may be particularly deleterious to the magnocellular neuron . .;0;0;1;0

comparison of developmental toxicology of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in rats using selected dosing paradigms.;"background: analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given nsaids on specific days during organogenesis. aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [asa]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces developmental anomalies when administered to wistar rats on gestational day (gd) 9, 10, or 11 (kimmel ca, wilson jg, schumacher hj. teratology 4:15-24, 1971). there are no published asa studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of gds 6 to 17. objectives of the current study were to compare results between sprague-dawley (sd) and wistar strains when asa is administered on gd 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in sd rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with asa when a multiple dosing paradigm is used. methods: asa was administered as a single dose on gd 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg) and from gd 6 to gd 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to sd rats. animals were killed on gd 21, and fetuses were examined viscerally. results: the literature evaluation suggested that nsaids induce ventricular septal defects (vsds) and midline defects (mds) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia (dh), mds, and vsds in rabbits (cook jc et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations, even though asa induces several other low-incidence malformations. in single dose studies, dh, md, and vsd were induced on gds 9 and 10. vsd also was noted following treatment on gd 11. in contrast, dh and md were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and vsd was noted across all dose groups. conclusions: high concordance in major developmental anomalies between wistar and sd rats were noted with the exception of vsd in the sd rats and hydrocephalus in the wistar rats. variations and malformations were similar when asa was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (gds 6 to 17). it was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with asa given at multiple doses.";0;0;1;0

modification by propranolol of cardiovascular effects of induced hypoglycaemia.;the cardiovascular effects of hypoglycaemia, with and without beta-blockade, were compared in fourteen healthy men. eight received insulin alone, and eight, including two of the original insulin-only group, were given propranolol and insulin. in the insulin-group the period of hypoglycaemia was associated with an increase in heart-rate and a fall in diastolic blood-pressure. in the propranolol-insulin group there was a significant fall in heart-rate in most subjects and an increase in diastolic pressure. typical s-t/t changes occurred in the insulin-group but in none of the propranolol-insulin group. hypertension in diabetics prone to hypoglycaemia attacks should not be treated with beta-blockers because these drugs may cause a sharp rise in blood-pressure in such patients.;1;0;0;0
long-term prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver failure.;background: the prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver failure remains unknown. aim: to examine whether paracetamol-induced acute liver failure increases long-term mortality. methods: we followed up all transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. we compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not. results: we included 641 patients. on average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol-induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% ci 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. these observations speak against long-term effects of acute liver failure. more likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure. conclusions: paracetamol-induced acute liver failure did not affect long-term mortality. clinical follow-up may be justified by the cause of the liver failure, but not by the liver failure itself.;0;1;0;0

does paracetamol cause urothelial cancer or renal papillary necrosis?;the risk of developing renal papillary necrosis or cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter or bladder associated with consumption of either phenacetin or paracetamol was calculated from data acquired by questionnaire from 381 cases and 808 controls. the risk of renal papillary necrosis was increased nearly 20-fold by consumption of phenacetin, which also increased the risk for cancer of the renal pelvis and bladder but not for ureteric cancer. by contrast, we were unable to substantiate an increased risk from paracetamol consumption for renal papillary necrosis or any of these cancers although there was a suggestion of an association with cancer of the ureter.;0;1;0;1
clinicopathologic features of brca-linked and sporadic ovarian cancer.;"context  most hereditary ovarian cancers are associated with germline mutations in brca1 or brca2 . attempts to define the clinical significance of brca mutation status in ovarian cancer have produced conflicting results , especially regarding survival . objective  to determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers have distinct clinical and pathological features compared with sporadic ( nonhereditary ) ovarian cancers . design and setting  retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed and treated at our institution , which is a comprehensive cancer center as designated by the national cancer institute , over a 12-year period ( december 1986 to august 1998 ) . patients  the study was restricted to patients of jewish origin because of the ease of brca1 and brca2 genotyping in this ethnic group . from the 189 patients who identified themselves as jewish , 88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline founder mutation in brca1 or brca2 . the remaining 101 cases from the same series not associated with a brca mutation and 2 additional groups ( gynecologic oncology group protocols 52 and 111 ) with ovarian cancer from clinical trials ( for the survival analysis ) were included for comparison . main outcome measures  age at diagnosis , surgical stage , histologic cell type and grade , and surgical outcome ; and response to chemotherapy and survival for advanced-stage ( ii and iv ) cases . results  hereditary cancers were rarely diagnosed before age 40 years and were common after age 60 years , with mean age at diagnosis being significantly younger for brca1- vs brca2-linked patients ( 54 vs 62 years ; p = . 04 ) . histology , grade , stage , and success of cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases . the hereditary group had a longer disease-free interval following primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group , with a median time to recurrence of 14 months and 7 months , respectively ( p hereditary cancers had improved survival compared with the nonhereditary group ( p = . 004 ) . for stage iii cancers , brca mutation status was an independent prognostic variable ( p = . 03 ) . conclusions  although brca-associated hereditary ovarian cancers in this population have surgical and pathological characteristics similar to those of sporadic cancers , advanced-stage hereditary cancer patients survive longer than nonhereditary cancer patients . age penetrance is greater for brca1-linked than for brca2-linked cancers in this population .";0;0;1;1

nimodipine prevents memory impairment caused by nitroglycerin-induced hypotension in adult mice.;"background: hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction. we tested the hypothesis that nimodipine (nimo) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin (ntg)-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory. methods: the passive avoidance (pa) paradigm was used to assess memory retention. for pa training, latencies (seconds) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered. latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial. ninety-six swiss-webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) ntg immediately after learning, 3) ntg 3 h after learning, 4) ntg and nimo, 5) vehicle, and 6) nimo alone. the extent of hypotension and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (pbto(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals. results: all groups exhibited similar training latencies (17.0 +/- 4.6 s). mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, ntg + nimo, or delayed ntg (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively). a kruskal-wallis 1-way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups (h = 15.34; p < 0.001). in a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of ntg (n = 3) and ntg + nimo (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm hg sem, respectively. mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with nimo alone decreased from 88.1 +/- 3.8 mm hg to 80.0 +/- 2.9 mm hg. the intergroup difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). pbto(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm hg sem in the ntg group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm hg sem in the ntg + nimo groups, respectively. there were no significant differences among groups. conclusion: in a pa retention paradigm, the injection of ntg immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect. nimo attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by ntg but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension. the observed effect of nimo may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension, because there were no differences in the pbto(2) indices among groups.";1;1;1;0

submicroscopic deletions at the wagr locus, revealed by nonradioactive in situ hybridization.;fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) with biotin-labeled probes mapping to 11p13 has been used for the molecular analysis of deletions of the wagr ( wilms tumor , aniridia , genitourinary abnormalities , and mental retardation ) locus . we have detected a submicroscopic 11p13 deletion in a child with inherited aniridia who subsequently presented with wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney , only revealed at surgery . the mother , who has aniridia , was also found to carry a deletion including both the aniridia candidate gene ( an2 ) and the wilms tumor predisposition gene ( wt1 ) . this is therefore a rare case of an inherited wagr deletion . wilms tumor has so far only been associated with sporadic de novo aniridia cases . we have shown that a cosmid probe for a candidate aniridia gene , homologous to the mouse pax-6 gene , is deleted in cell lines from aniridia patients with previously characterized deletions at 11p13 , while another cosmid marker mapping between two aniridia-associated translocation breakpoints ( and hence a second candidate marker ) is present on both chromosomes . these results support the pax-6 homologue as a strong candidate for the an2 gene . fish with cosmid probes has proved to be a fast and reliable technique for the molecular analysis of deletions . it can be used with limited amounts of material and has strong potential for clinical applications . .;0;1;1;1
posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced parkinson's disease.;"background: posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced parkinson's disease, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short-term follow-up. methods: forty patients with parkinson's disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal (""off"" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens (""on"" period). all patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years. results: the percent improvements at six months were as follows: off-period score for overall motor function, 28 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off-period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on-period score for contralateral dyskinesias, 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on-period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias, 44 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent). the improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off-period parkinsonism, contralateral bradykinesia, and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years. the improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months. approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery. the complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication. conclusions: in late-stage parkinson's disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias and off-period disability. much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year. the on-period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.";0;0;1;0

diseases of peripheral nerves as seen in the nigerian african.;the anatomical and aetiological diagnoses of peripheral nerve disease excluding its primary benign and malignant disorders, as seen in 358 nigerians are presented. there is a male preponderance and the peak incidence is in the fourth decade. sensori-motor neuropathy was the commonest presentation (50%). guillain-barr   syndrome was the commonest identifiable cause (15.6%), accounting for half of the cases with motor neuropathy. peripheral neuropathy due to nutritional deficiency of thiamine and riboflavin was common (10.1%) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori-motor neuropathy. diabetes mellitus was the major cause of autonomic neuropathy. isoniazid was the most frequent agent in drug-induced neuropathy. migraine (20%) was not an uncommon cause of cranial neuropathy although malignancies arising from the reticuloendothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more frequent (26%). in 26.5% of all the cases, the aetiology of the neuropathy was undetermined. heredofamilial and connective tissue disorders were rare. some of the factors related to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of the neuropathies are briefly discussed.;0;0;1;0
hypertension in neuroblastoma induced by imipramine.;hypertension is a well-known finding in some patients with neuroblastoma. however, it has not previously been described in association with the use of imipramine. we report the occurrence of severe hypertension (blood pressure 190/160) in a 4-year-old girl with neuroblastoma who was given imipramine to control a behavior disorder. it was determined later that this patient's tumor was recurring at the time of her hypertensive episode. since she had no blood pressure elevation at initial diagnosis and none following discontinuation of the imipramine (when she was in florid relapse), we believe that this drug rather than her underlying disease alone caused her hypertension. the mechanism for this reaction is believed to be increased levels of vasoactive catecholamines due to interference of their physiologic inactivation by imipramine. from this experience, we urge extreme caution in the use of tricyclic antidepressants in children with active neuroblastoma.;1;0;1;1
population-based study of risk of venous thromboembolism associated with various oral contraceptives.;background: four studies published since december, 1995, reported that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (vte) was higher in women who used oral contraceptives (ocs) containing the third-generation progestagens gestodene or desogestrel than in users of ocs containing second-generation progestagens. however, confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings. the aim of our study was to re-examine the association between risk of vte and oc use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies. methods: we used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the uk. the study was based on the medical records of about 540,000 women born between 1941 and 1981. all women who had a recorded diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis, venous thrombosis not otherwise specified, or pulmonary embolus during the study period, and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of vte. we did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of vte in users of the main oc preparations, and a nested case-control study to calculate the odds ratios of vte associated with use of different types of oc, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. in the case-control study, we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth, practice, and current use of ocs. we used a multiple logistic regression model that included body-mass index, number of cycles, change in type of oc prescribed within 3 months of the event, previous pregnancy, and concurrent disease. findings: 85 women met the inclusion criteria for vte, two of whom were users of progestagen-only ocs. of the 83 cases of vte associated with use of combined ocs, 43 were recorded as deep-vein thrombosis, 35 as pulmonary thrombosis, and five as venous thrombosis not otherwise specified. the crude rate of vte per 10,000 woman-years was 4.10 in current users of any oc, 3.10 in users of second-generation ocs, and 4.96 in users of third-generation preparations. after adjustment for age, the rate ratio of vte in users of third-generation relative to second-generation ocs was 1.68 (95% ci 1.04-2.75). logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of vte between users of third-generation and second-generation ocs. among users of third-generation progestagens, the risk of vte was higher in users of desogestrel with 20 g ethinyloestradiol than in users of gestodene or desogestrel with 30 g ethinyloestradiol. with all second-generation ocs as the reference, the odds ratios for vte were 3.49 (1.21-10.12) for desogestrel plus 20 g ethinyloestradiol and 1.18 (0.66-2.17) for the other third-generation progestagens. interpretation: the previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third-generation ocs when compared with second-generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age. the increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible, and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and, thus, confounding.;0;0;1;0
low frequency of brca1 germline mutations in 45 german breast/ovarian cancer families.;in this study we investigated 45 german breast / ovarian cancer families for germline mutations in the brca1 gene . we identified four germline mutations in three breast cancer families and in one breast-ovarian cancer family . among these were one frameshift mutation , one nonsense mutation , one novel splice site mutation , and one missense mutation . the missense mutation was also found in 2 . 8 % of the general population , suggesting that it is not disease associated . the average age of disease onset in those families harbouring causative mutations was between 32 . 3 and 37 . 4 years , whereas the family harbouring the missense mutation had an average age of onset of 51 . 2 years . these findings show that brca1 is implicated in a small fraction of breast / ovarian cancer families suggesting the involvement of another susceptibility gene ( s );0;0;0;1

study of the role of vitamin b12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing hematologic toxicity of zidovudine.;"a prospective, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin b12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing zidovudine (zdv)-induced bone marrow suppression. seventy-five human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients with cd4+ cell counts < 500/mm3 were randomized to receive either zdv (500 mg daily) alone (group i, n = 38) or in combination with folinic acid (15 mg daily) and intramascular vitamin b12 (1000 micrograms monthly) (group ii, n = 37). finally, 15 patients were excluded from the study (noncompliance 14, death 1); thus, 60 patients (31 in group i and 29 in group ii) were eligible for analysis. no significant differences between groups were found at enrollment. during the study, vitamin b12 and folate levels were significantly higher in group ii patients; however, no differences in hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and white-cell, neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. severe hematologic toxicity (neutrophil count < 1000/mm3 and/or hemoglobin < 8 g/dl) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group i and 7 assigned to group ii. there was no correlation between vitamin b12 or folate levels and development of myelosuppression. vitamin b12 and folinic acid supplementation of zdv therapy does not seem useful in preventing or reducing zdv-induced myelotoxicity in the overall treated population, although a beneficial effect in certain subgroups of patients cannot be excluded.";0;0;1;0

cloning of the huntington disease region in yeast artificial chromosomes.;the gene responsible for huntington disease has been localized to a 2 . 5 million base pair ( mb ) region between the loci d4s10 and d4s168 on the short arm of chromosome 4 . as part of a strategy to clone the hd gene on the basis of its chromosomal location , we isolated genomic dna from the hd region as a set of overlapping yeast artificial chromosome ( yac ) clones . twenty-eight yac clones were identified by screening human yac libraries with twelve pcr-based sequence-tagged sites ( stss ) from the region . we assembled the yac clones into overlapping sets by hybridizing them to a large number of dna probes from the hd region , including the stss . in addition , we isolated the ends of the human dna inserts of most of the yac clones to assist in the construction of the contig . although almost half of the yacs appear to contain chimeric inserts and several contain internal deletions or other rearrangements , we were able to obtain over 2 . 2 mb of the hd region in yacs , including one continuous segment of 2 . 0 mb covering the region that most likely contains the hd gene . ten of the twenty eight yac clones comprise a minimal set spanning the 2 . 2 mb . these clones provide reagents for the complete characterization of this region of the genome and for the eventual isolation of the hd gene .;0;0;1;0
severe reversible left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to accidental iatrogenic epinephrine overdose.;catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy due to chronic excess of endogenous catecholamines has been recognized for decades as a clinical phenomenon. in contrast, reports of myocardial dysfunction due to acute iatrogenic overdose are rare. a 35-year-old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of epinephrine developed myocardial stunning that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise, profound, albeit transient, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis. our case illustrates the serious consequences of medical errors that can be avoided through improved medication labeling and staff supervision.;1;0;0;0

identification of apc2, a homologue of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor .;the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) tumour-suppressor protein controls the wnt signalling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta ( gsk-3beta ) , axin / conductin and betacatenin . complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin . in colon carcinoma cells , loss of apc leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus , where it binds to and activates the tcf-4 transcription factor ( reviewed in [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) . here , we report the identification and genomic structure of apc homologues . mammalian apc2 , which closely resembles apc in overall domain structure , was functionally analyzed and shown to contain two samp domains , both of which are required for binding to conductin . like apc , apc2 regulates the formation of active betacatenin-tcf complexes , as demonstrated using transient transcriptional activation assays in apc - / - colon carcinoma cells . human apc2 maps to chromosome 19p13 . 3 . apc and apc2 may therefore have comparable functions in development and cancer .;0;0;0;1
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for levodopa-induced dyskinesias in parkinson's disease.;"in a placebo-controlled, single-blinded, crossover study, we assessed the effect of ""real"" repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) versus ""sham"" rtms (placebo) on peak dose dyskinesias in patients with parkinson's disease (pd). ten patients with pd and prominent dyskinesias had rtms (1,800 pulses; 1 hz rate) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice, once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series. direct comparison between sham and real rtms effects showed no significant difference in clinician-assessed dyskinesia severity. however, comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in dyskinesia severity following real rtms but not placebo. the major effect was on dystonia subscore. similarly, in patient diaries, although both treatments caused reduction in subjective dyskinesia scores during the days of intervention, the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rtms only. following rtms, no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and pd symptoms were noted. the results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low-frequency rtms on dyskinesias in pd. the effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses.";0;1;1;0
is phenytoin administration safe in a hypothermic child?;a male neonate with a chiari malformation and a leaking myelomeningocoele underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by repair of myelomeningocoele. during anaesthesia and surgery, he inadvertently became moderately hypothermic. intravenous phenytoin was administered during the later part of the surgery for seizure prophylaxis. following phenytoin administration, the patient developed acute severe bradycardia, refractory to atropine and adrenaline. the cardiac depressant actions of phenytoin and hypothermia can be additive. administration of phenytoin in the presence of hypothermia may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children. as phenytoin is a commonly used drug, clinicians need to be aware of this interaction.;0;1;1;0

neurocognitive and neuroradiologic central nervous system late effects in children treated on pediatric oncology group (pog) p9605 (standard risk) and p9201 (lesser risk) acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocols (accl0131): a methotrexate consequence? a report from the children's oncology group.;"concerns about long-term methotrexate (mtx) neurotoxicity in the 1990s led to modifications in intrathecal (it) therapy, leucovorin rescue, and frequency of systemic mtx administration in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. in this study, neurocognitive outcomes and neuroradiologic evidence of leukoencephalopathy were compared in children treated with intense central nervous system (cns)-directed therapy (p9605) versus those receiving fewer cns-directed treatment days during intensive consolidation (p9201). a total of 66 children from 16 pediatric oncology group institutions with ""standard-risk"" acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1.00 to 9.99 years at diagnosis, without evidence of cns leukemia at diagnosis were enrolled on accl0131: 28 from p9201 and 38 from p9605. magnetic resonance imaging scans and standard neuropsychological tests were performed >2.6 years after the end of treatment. significantly more p9605 patients developed leukoencephalopathy compared with p9201 patients (68%, 95% confidence interval 49%-83% vs. 22%, 95% confidence interval 5%-44%; p=0.001) identified as late as 7.7 years after the end of treatment. overall, 40% of patients scored <85 on either verbal or performance iq. children on both studies had significant attention problems, but p9605 children scored below average on more neurocognitive measures than those treated on p9201 (82%, 14/17 measures vs. 24%, 4/17 measures). this supports ongoing concerns about intensive mtx exposure as a major contributor to cns late effects.";0;0;1;1

gaba involvement in naloxone induced reversal of respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental.;no agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by cns depressants, such as general anesthetics. in this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased gaba, decreased glutamate, and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem. pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental. 50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in gaba and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain. naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory paralysis, glutamate and gaba levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum. these data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves gaba in its action.;0;0;1;0
genetic instability in human ovarian cancer cell lines.;"we have analyzed the stability of microsatellites in cell lines derived from human ovarian cancers and found that 5 out of 10 of the ovarian tumor cell lines are genetically unstable at the majority of the loci analyzed . in clones and subclones derived serially from one of these cell lines ( 2774 ; serous cystadenocarcinoma ) , a very high proportion of microsatellites distributed in many different regions of the genome change their size in a mercurial fashion . we conclude that genomic instability in ovarian tumors is a dynamic and ongoing process whose high frequency may have been previously underestimated by pcr-based allelotyping of bulk tumor tissue . we have identified the source of the genetic instability in one ovarian tumor as a point mutation ( r524p ) in the human mismatch-repair gene msh2 ( salmonella muts homologue ) , which has recently been shown to be involved in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer . patient 2774 was a 38-year-old heterozygote , and her normal tissue carried both mutant and wild-type alleles of the human msh2 gene . however the wild-type allele was lost at some point early during tumorigenesis so that dna isolated either from the patients ovarian tumor or from the 2774 cell line carries only the mutant allele of the human msh2 gene . the genetic instability observed in the tumor and cell line dna , together with the germ-line mutation in a mismatch-repair gene , suggest that the msh2 gene is involved in the onset and / or progression in a subset of ovarian cancer . .";0;0;1;1

inactivation of the friedreich ataxia mouse gene leads to early embryonic lethality without iron accumulation.;friedreich ataxia ( frda ) , the most common autosomal recessive ataxia , is caused in almost all cases by homozygous intronic expansions resulting in the loss of frataxin , a mitochondrial protein conserved through evolution , and involved in mitochondrial iron homeostasis . yeast knockout models , and histological and biochemical data from patient heart biopsies or autopsies indicate that the frataxin defect causes a specific iron-sulfur protein deficiency and mitochondrial iron accumulation leading to the pathological changes . affected human tissues are rarely available to further examine this hypothesis . to study the mechanism of the disease , we generated a mouse model by deletion of exon 4 leading to inactivation of the frda gene product . we show that homozygous deletions cause embryonic lethality a few days after implantation , demonstrating an important role for frataxin during early development . these results suggest that the milder phenotype in humans is due to residual frataxin expression associated with the expansion mutations . surprisingly , in the frataxin knockout mouse , no iron accumulation was observed during embryonic resorption , suggesting that cell death could be due to a mechanism independent of iron accumulation . .;1;0;1;0

learning and memory deficits in ecstasy users and their neural correlates during a face-learning task.;it has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance. in addition, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls. to address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users (nestor, l., roberts, g., garavan, h., hester, r., 2008. deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users. neuroimage 40, 1328-1339). ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users. a conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy-specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions. ecstasy-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (acc) and left posterior cingulated cortex. in both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. these results elucidated ecstasy-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use. these ecstasy-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy.;0;0;1;0

effects of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (captopril) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular coagulation in the rat.;induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid (amca) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man. injection of captopril (1 mg/kg), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ace), reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model. the lung weights were lower and pao2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent. the contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed, indicating that captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein. renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by captopril. the amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and amca alone. it is suggested that the effects of captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of angiotension ii and an increase in prostacyclin (secondary to an increase in bradykinin). captopril may, by the same mechanism, reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli, with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced.;0;1;0;0

central cardiovascular effects of avp and anp in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats.;the purpose of the present study was to compare influence of central arginine vasopressin (avp) and of atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) on control of arterial blood pressure (map) and heart rate (hr) in normotensive (wky) and spontaneously hypertensive (shr) rats. three series of experiments were performed on 30 wky and 30 shr, chronically instrumented with guide tubes in the lateral ventricle (lv) and arterial and venous catheters. map and hr were monitored before and after i.v. injections of either vehicle or 1, 10 and 50 ng of avp and 25, 125 and 500 ng of anp. sensitivity of cardiac component of baroreflex (ccb), expressed as a slope of the regression line was determined from relationships between systolic arterial pressure (sap) and hr period (hrp) during phenylephrine (phe)-induced hypertension and sodium nitroprusside (sn)-induced hypotension. ccb was measured before and after administration of either vehicle, avp, anp, or both peptides together. increases of map occurred after lv administration of 1, 10 and 50 ng of avp in wky and of 10 and 50 ng in shr. anp did not cause significant changes in map in both strains as compared to vehicle, but it abolished avp-induced map increase in wky and shr. ccb was reduced in wky and shr after lv administration of avp during sn-induced hypotension. in shr but not in wky administration of anp, avp and anp + avp decreased ccb during phe-induced map elevation. the results indicate that centrally applied avp and anp exert differential effects on blood pressure and baroreflex control of heart rate in wky and shr and suggest interaction of these two peptides in blood pressure regulation at the level of central nervous system.;1;0;0;0
absence of disease phenotype and intergenerational stability of the cag repeat in transgenic mice expressing the human huntington disease transcript.;the mutation underlying huntington disease ( hd ) is cag expansion in the first exon of the hd gene . in order to investigate the role of cag expansion in the pathogenesis of hd , we have produced transgenic mice containing the full length human hd cdna with 44 cag repeats . by 1 year , these mice have no behavioral abnormalities and morphometric analysis at 6 ( one animal ) and 9 ( two animals ) months age revealed no changes . despite high levels of mrna expression , there was no evidence of the hd gene product in any of these transgenic mice . in vitro transfection studies indicated that the inclusion of 120 bp of the 5 utr in the cdna construct and the presence of a frameshift mutation at nucleotide 2349 prevented expression of the hd cdna . these findings suggest that the pathogenesis of hd is not mediated through dna-protein interaction and that presence of the rna transcript with an expanded cag repeat is insufficient to cause the disease . rather , translation of the cag is crucial for the pathogenesis of hd . in contrast to that seen in humans , the cag repeat in these mice was remarkably stable in 97 meioses . this suggests that genomic sequences may play a critical role in influencing repeat instability . .;0;0;1;0

thalidomide has limited single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory indolent non-hodgkin lymphomas: a phase ii trial of the cancer and leukemia group b.;thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated activity in multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. its activity is believed to be due modulation of the tumour milieu, including downregulation of angiogenesis and inflammatory cytokines. between july 2001 and april 2004, 24 patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphomas received thalidomide 200 mg daily with escalation by 100 mg daily every 1-2 weeks as tolerated, up to a maximum of 800 mg daily. patients had received a median of 2 (range, 1-4) prior regimens. of 24 evaluable patients, two achieved a complete remission and one achieved a partial remission for an overall response rate of 12.5% (95% confidence interval: 2.6-32.4%). eleven patients progressed during therapy. grade 3-4 adverse effects included myelosuppression, fatigue, somnolence/depressed mood, neuropathy and dyspnea. of concern was the occurrence of four thromboembolic events. our results failed to demonstrate an important response rate to single agent thalidomide in indolent lymphomas and contrast with the higher activity level reported with the second generation immunomodulatory agent, lenalidomide.;0;0;1;1
the 5' end of the brca1 gene lies within a duplicated region of human chromosome 17q21.;to begin to address the hypothesis that abnormal regulation of the breast / ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca1 is a critical step in sporadic breast / ovarian tumorigenesis , we have determined the detailed structure of the brca1 genomic region . we show that this region of the genome contains a tandem duplication of approximately 30 kilobases , which results in two copies of brca1 exons 1 and 2 , of exons 1 and 3 of the adjacent 1a1-3b gene and of the previously reported 295 base pair intergenic region . sequence analysis of the duplicated exons of brca1 and 1a1-3b and flanking genomic dna reveals maintenance of the intron-exon structure and a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity , suggesting that these are non-processed pseudogenes and that the duplication is a recent event in evolutionary terms . we also show that a processed pseudogene of the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein p1 ( arpp1 ) is inserted directly upstream of pseudo-brca1 exon 1a . we believe that these findings could not only confound brca1 mutation analysis , but could have implications for the normal and abnormal regulation of brca1 transcription , translation and function . .;0;0;1;1

a prospective study on the dose dependency of cardiotoxicity induced by mitomycin c.;since 1975 mitomycin c (mmc) has been suggested to be cardiotoxic, especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin. data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known. we have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects. forty-four mmc-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated. all patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest x-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (ef) determinations. the results were evaluated per cumulative dose level. one of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m-2 mmc and only 150 mg m-2 doxorubicin. the cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in ef determined during a cold pressor test. none of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity, nor did the studied parameters change. the literature on this subject was also reviewed. based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that mmc-related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with doxorubicin. the incidence is likely to be less than 10% even for this risk group.;1;0;0;0

long-term lithium treatment and the kidney. interim report on fifty patients.;this is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long-term lithium treatment on the kidney. creatinine clearance, maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long-term lithium for more than one year. these findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to lithium, available for most of our patients. no evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during lithium treatment. low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-lithium values. urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients. the concentration defect appeared reversible, at least in part. polyuria above 3 litres/24 hours was found in 10% of patients. an attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings.;0;1;1;0
adequate timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis c.;background: hemolytic anemia is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin. because of ribavirin-related hemolytic anemia, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy. in this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy. methods: thirty-seven of 160 patients who had hcv-genotype 1b, had high virus load, and received 24-week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level <10 g/dl or anemia-related signs during therapy. after that, these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin (200 mg) per day. after reduction of ribavirin, 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks (group a). however, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia-related severe side effects occurred (group b). we assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups a and b. results: a sustained virological response (svr) was 29.6% (8/27) in group a and 10% (1/10) in group b, respectively. a 34.4% (12/27) of svr + biological response in group a was higher than 10% (1/10) in group b ( p = 0.051), with slight significance. with respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction, a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or =10 g/dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with <10 g/dl ( p = 0.036). conclusions: reduction of ribavirin at hemoglobin level > or =10 g/dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects.;0;1;1;0

systematic analysis of coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene defects in hereditary coproporphyria and mutation update.;"hereditary coproporphyria ( hc ) is an acute hepatic porphyria with autosomal dominant inheritance caused by deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase ( cpo ) . clinical manifestations of the disease are characterized by acute attacks of neurological dysfunction often precipitated by drugs , fasting , cyclical hormonal changes , or infectious diseases . skin photosensitivity may also be present . the seven exons , the exon / intron boundaries and part of 3 noncoding sequence of the cpo gene were systematically analyzed by an exon-by-exon denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( dgge ) strategy followed by direct sequencing in seven unrelated heterozygous hc patients from france , holland , and czech republic . seven novel mutations and two new polymorphisms were detected . among these mutations  two are missense ( g197w , w427r ) , two are nonsense ( q306x , q385x ) , two are small deletions ( 662de14bp ; 1168del3bp removing a glycine at position 390 ) , and one is a splicing mutation ( ivs1-15c-- > g ) which creates a new acceptor splice site . the pathological significance of the point mutations g197w , w427r , and the in-frame deletion 390delgly were assessed by their respective expression in a prokaryotic system using site-directed mutagenesis . these mutations resulted in the absence or a dramatic decrease of cpo activity . the two polymorphisms were localized in noncoding part of the gene  1 ) a c / g polymorphism in the promotor region , 142 bp upstream from the transcriptional initiation site ( -142c / g ) , and 2 ) a 6 bp deletion polymorphism in the 3 noncoding part of the cpo gene , 574 bp downstream of the last base of the normal termination codon ( + 574 delattctt ) . five intragenic dimorphisms are now well characterized and the high degree of allelic heterogeneity in hc is demonstrated with seven new different mutations making a total of nineteen cpo gene defects reported so far . .";0;1;1;0
familial male breast cancer is not linked to the brca1 locus on chromosome 17q.;breast cancer in men is about a hundredfold less common than in women and this has hindered research into its genetic basis . we have examined 22 families with at least one case of male breast cancer for linkage to the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer locus , brca1 , on chromosome 17q . we found strong evidence against linkage to brca1 ( lod score-16 . 63 ) and the best estimate of the proportion of linked families was 0 % ( 95 % ci 0-18 % ) . our results indicate that there is a gene ( s ) other than brca1 which predisposes to early-onset breast cancer in women and which confers a higher risk of male breast cancer . identification of additional pedigrees that include cases of male breast cancer may therefore facilitate the mapping and isolation of this gene .;0;0;0;1

longitudinal association of alcohol use with hiv disease progression and psychological health of women with hiv.;we evaluated the association of alcohol consumption and depression, and their effects on hiv disease progression among women with hiv. the study included 871 women with hiv who were recruited from 1993-1995 in four us cities. the participants had physical examination, medical record extraction, and venipuncture, cd4+t-cell counts determination, measurement of depression symptoms (using the self-report center for epidemiological studies-depression scale), and alcohol use assessment at enrollment, and semiannually until march 2000. multilevel random coefficient ordinal models as well as multilevel models with joint responses were used in the analysis. there was no significant association between level of alcohol use and cd4+ t-cell counts. when participants were stratified by antiretroviral therapy (art) use, the association between alcohol and cd4+ t-cell did not reach statistical significance. the association between alcohol consumption and depression was significant (p<0.001). depression had a significant negative effect on cd4+ t-cell counts over time regardless of art use. our findings suggest that alcohol consumption has a direct association with depression. moreover, depression is associated with hiv disease progression. our findings have implications for the provision of alcohol use interventions and psychological resources to improve the health of women with hiv.;0;0;1;0

hypoxia in renal disease with proteinuria and/or glomerular hypertension.;despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods have been available. in this study, we developed a new hypoxia-responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia-responsive element of the 5' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia-sensing transgenic rat. we then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney. with this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model. expression of the hypoxia-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes. the degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models. finally, we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive, ed-1-positive, and terminal dutp nick-end labeled-positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model. we propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases.;1;1;0;0

molecular basis of essential fructosuria: molecular cloning and mutational analysis of human ketohexokinase (fructokinase).;essential fructosuria is one of the oldest known inborn errors of metabolism . it is a benign condition which is believed to result from deficiency of hepatic fructokinase ( ketohexokinase , khk , e . c . 2 . 7 . 1 . 3 ) . this enzyme catalyses the first step of metabolism of dietary fructose , conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate . despite the early recognition of this disorder , the primary structure of human khk and the molecular basis of essential fructosuria have not been previously defined . in this report , the isolation and sequencing of full-length cdna clones encoding human ketohexokinase are described . alternative mrna species and alternative khk isozymes are produced by alternative polyadenylation and splicing of the khk gene . the khk proteins show a high level of sequence conservation relative to rat khk . direct evidence that mutation of the khk structural gene is the cause of essential fructosuria was also obtained . in a well-characterized family , in which three of eight siblings have fructosuria , all affected individuals are compound heterozygotes for two mutations gly40arg and ala43thr . both mutations result from g-- > a transitions , and each alters the same conserved region of the khk protein . neither mutation was seen in a sample of 52 unrelated control individuals . an additional conservative amino acid change ( val49iie ) was present on the khk allele bearing ala43thr;0;1;0;0

the enhancement of aminonucleoside nephrosis by the co-administration of protamine.;an experimental model of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (fsgs) was developed in rats by the combined administration of puromycin-aminonucleoside (amns) and protamine sulfate (ps). male sprague-dawley rats, uninephrectomized three weeks before, received daily injections of subcutaneous amns (1 mg/100 g body wt) and intravenous ps (2 separated doses of 2.5 mg/100 g body wt) for four days. the series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day intervals. the animals were sacrificed on days 24, 52, and 80. they developed nephrotic syndrome and finally renal failure. the time-course curve of creatinine clearance dropped and showed significant difference (p less than 0.01) from that of each control group, such as, amns alone, ps alone or saline injected. their glomeruli showed changes of progressive fsgs. the ultrastructural studies in the initial stage revealed significant lack of particles of perfused ruthenium red on the lamina rara externa and marked changes in epithelial cell cytoplasm. therefore, it is suggested that the administration of ps enhances the toxicity of amns on the glomerulus and readily produces progressive fsgs in rats resulting in the end-stage renal disease.;0;1;0;0

quinidine hepatitis.;long-term administration of quinidine was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of sgot, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase. liver biopsy showed active hepatitis. discontinuance of quinidine therapy led to normalization of liver function tests. a challenge dose of quinidine caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of sgot, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic acid dehydrogenase values. we concluded that this patient had quinidine hepatotoxicity and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation. this report also suggests that, even after long-term administration, the hepatic toxicity is reversible.;0;1;1;0

long-term efficacy and adverse event of nifedipine sustained-release tablets for cyclosporin a-induced hypertension in patients with psoriasis.;thirteen psoriatic patients with hypertension during the course of cyclosporin a therapy were treated for 25 months with a calcium channel blocker, sustained-release nifedipine, to study the clinical antihypertensive effects and adverse events during treatment with both drugs. seven of the 13 patients had exhibited a subclinical hypertensive state before cyclosporin a therapy. both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased significantly after 4 weeks of nifedipine therapy, and blood pressure was maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 months. the adverse events during combined therapy with cyclosporin a and nifedipine included an increase in blood urea nitrogen levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of gingival hyperplasia in 2 of the 13 patients. our findings indicate that sustained-release nifedipine is useful for hypertensive psoriatic patients under long-term treatment with cyclosporin a, but that these patients should be monitored for gingival hyperplasia.;1;0;0;0
the alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma pax3/fkhr fusion protein is a transcriptional activator.;"chimeric transcription factors , created by gene fusions as the result of chromosomal translocations , have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathologically disparate solid tumors . the pax3 / fkhr fusion gene , formed by a t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , encodes a hybrid protein that contains both pax3 dna binding domains , the paired box and homeodomain , linked to the bisected dna binding domain of fkhr , a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors . here we report that pax3 and pax3 / fkhr display similar , but not identical transactivation activities when tested with model pax recognition sequences . no functional role could be ascribed solely to the residual fkhr binding domain present in the fusion protein , but fkhr was found to contribute a strong carboxyl terminal activation domain replacing the one located in the unrearranged pax3 gene . we show that the native pax3 / fkhr protein present in tumor cells with this translocation has transcriptional characteristics similar to the in vitro expressed protein . the ability of the pax3 / fkhr hybrid protein to bind dna in a sequence specific manner and to transactivate the expression of artificial reporter genes suggests that its aberrant expression could subvert the transcriptional programs that normally control the growth , differentiation , and survival of primitive myogenic precursors in vivo . .";0;0;1;1
prenatal cocaine exposure and cranial sonographic findings in preterm infants.;purpose: prenatal cocaine exposure has been linked with subependymal hemorrhage and the formation of cysts that are detectable on cranial sonography in neonates born at term. we sought to determine if prenatal cocaine exposure increases the incidence of subependymal cysts in preterm infants. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial sonograms obtained during a 1-year period on 122 premature (< 36 weeks of gestation) infants. infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups: those exposed to cocaine and those not exposed to cocaine. infants were assigned to the cocaine-exposed group if there was a maternal history of cocaine abuse during pregnancy or if maternal or neonatal urine toxicology results were positive at the time of delivery. results: five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug histories. the incidence of subependymal cysts in the 117 remaining infants was 14% (16 of 117). the incidence of subependymal cysts in infants exposed to cocaine prenatally was 44% (8 of 18) compared with 8% (8 of 99) in the unexposed group (p < 0.01). conclusions: we found an increased incidence of subependymal cyst formation in preterm infants who were exposed to cocaine prenatally. this result is consistent with results of similar studies in term infants.;0;1;1;0
pethidine-associated seizure in a healthy adolescent receiving pethidine for postoperative pain control.;a healthy 17-year-old male received standard intermittent doses of pethidine via a patient-controlled analgesia (pca) pump for management of postoperative pain control. twenty-three h postoperatively he developed a brief self-limited seizure. both plasma pethidine and norpethidine were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation. no other risk factors for cns toxicity were identified. this method allowed frequent self-dosing of pethidine at short time intervals and rapid accumulation of pethidine and norpethidine. the routine use of pethidine via pca even for a brief postoperative analgesia should be reconsidered.;0;0;1;0
predominance of the adrenomyeloneuropathy phenotype of x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in the netherlands: a survey of 30 kindreds.;x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( x-ald ) is an inherited disorder of peroxisomal beta-oxidation associated with accumulation of saturated very long-chain fatty acids , which results in central and peripheral demyelination and in impaired function of adrenal cortex and testes . the phenotypic expression is highly variable , childhood cerebral ald ( ccald ) and adrenomyeloneuropathy ( amn ) being the main variants . we explored the 30 dutch kindreds well known to the dutch x-ald / amn study group and phenotyped 77 male patients  35 ( 46 % ) had amn and 24 ( 31 % ) ccald or adolescent cerebral ald ( adolcald ) . these percentages differ significantly from previous reports , in which 25 to 28 % of the patients developed amn and 53 to 57 % ccald or adolcald . our findings indicate that--at least in the netherlands--amn may be the most frequent phenotype of x-ald . .;0;1;1;0
tacrolimus-related seizure after pediatric liver transplantation--a single-center experience.;to identify the risk factors for new-onset seizures after pediatric lt and to assess their clinical implications and long-term prognosis. the clinical and laboratory data of 27 consecutive children who underwent lt from january 2007 to december 2010 in our center were analyzed retrospectively. patients were divided into seizures group and a non-seizures group. pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative data were collected. seizures occurred in four children, an incidence of 14.8%. all exhibited generalized tonic-clonic seizures within the first two wk after lt. univariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with seizures after pediatric lt included gender, pediatric end-stage liver disease score before surgery, child-pugh score before surgery, serum total bilirubin after surgery, and trough tac level. multivariate analysis showed that trough tac level was the only independent risk factor associated with the seizures. all children who experienced seizures survived with good graft function and remained seizure-free without anti-epileptic drugs over a mean follow-up period of 33.7 + 14.6 months. high trough tac level was the predominant factor that contributed to seizures in the early post-operative period after pediatric lt. high peld and child-pugh scores before lt and high post-operative serum tbil may be contributory risk factors for tac-related seizures.;0;1;1;0

spectrum of hsnf5/ini1 somatic mutations in human cancer and genotype-phenotype correlations.;the hsnf5 / ini1 gene which encodes a member of the swi / snf chromatin atp-dependent remodeling complex , is a new tumor suppressor gene localized on chromosome 22q11 . 2 and recently shown to be mutated in malignant rhabdoid tumors . we have searched for hsnf5 / ini1 mutations in 229 tumors of various origins using a screening method based on denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography . a total of 31 homozygous deletions and 36 point alterations were identified . point mutations were scattered along the coding sequence and included 15 nonsense , 15 frameshift , three splice site , two missense and one editing mutations . mutations were retrieved in most rhabdoid tumors , whatever their sites of occurrence , indicating the common pathogenetic origin of these tumors . recurrent hsnf5 / ini1 alterations were also observed in choroid plexus carcinomas and in a subset of central primitive neuroectodermal tumors ( cpnets ) and medulloblastomas . in contrast , hsnf5 / ini1 point mutations were not detected in breast cancers , wilms tumors , gliomas , ependymomas , sarcomas and other tumor types , even though most analyzed cases harbored loss of heterozygosity at 22q11 . 2 loci . these results suggest that rhabdoid tumors , choroid plexus carcinomas and a subset of medulloblastomas and cpnets share common pathways of oncogenesis related to hsnf5 / ini1 alteration and that hsnf5 / ini1 mutations define a genetically homogeneous family of highly aggressive cancers mainly occurring in young children and frequently , but not always , exhibiting a rhabdoid phenotype;0;0;1;1

the natural history of vigabatrin associated visual field defects in patients electing to continue their medication.;"purpose: to determine the natural history of visual field defects in a group of patients known to have vigabatrin-associated changes who elected to continue the medication because of good seizure control. methods: all patients taking vigabatrin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs for at least 5 years (range 5-12 years) were entered into a visual surveillance programme. patients were followed up at 6-monthly intervals for not less than 18 months (range 18-43 months). in all, 16 patients with unequivocal defects continued the medication. following already published methodology (eye 2002; 16;567-571) monocular mean radial degrees (mrds) to the i/4e isopter on goldmann perimetry was calculated for the right eye at the time of discovery of a visual field defect and again after not less than 18 months follow-up. results: mean right eye mrd at presentation was 36.98 degrees (range 22.25-51.0), compared to 38.40 degrees (range 22.5-49.75) after follow-up; p=0.338 unpaired t-test. only one patient demonstrated a deterioration in visual field during the study period and discontinued treatment. conclusion: established visual field defects presumed to be due to vigabatrin therapy did not usually progress in spite of continuing use of the medication. these data give support to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of vigabatrin-associated visual field defects may be an idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction rather than dose-dependent toxicity.";0;0;1;0
the attenuating effect of carteolol hydrochloride, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in rats.;it is known that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of akathisia, one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment. neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, a model of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic-induced akathisia in humans, although neuroleptic-induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic-induced akathisia. therefore, the effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. carteolol, as well as propranolol and biperiden, inhibited the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. the inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol, but was weaker than that of biperiden. carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats. carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats. in addition, carteolol did not evoke 5-ht1a receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitch in rats. finally, carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine-induced lethality in rats. these results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol-induced catalepsy via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity.;0;0;1;0

difficulties in the ascertainment of c9 deficiency: lessons to be drawn from a compound heterozygote c9-deficient subject.;a group of patients with long-surviving mismatched kidney allografts were investigated for complement function using haemolytic assays in agarose gels . one patient was found to have no alternative pathway activity but a low normal classical pathway . surprisingly , investigation revealed that the patients complement was normal for all components except c9 , which was functionally absent . the patient was shown to be heterozygous for dna markers in the c6 , c7 and c9 region of chromosome 5 and therefore appears to be a compound heterozygote for two uncharacterized c9 deficiency genes . serological analysis by elisa revealed that he has trace concentrations of a non-functional c9 molecule . western blot analysis was not sufficiently sensitive to permit detection of this molecule . we hypothesize that the patient is heterozygous for a complete deficiency of c9 and for a gene directing hyposynthesis of a defective c9 . we also suggest that c9 deficiency may be more common among caucasians than has been reported . .;0;1;0;0
emerin, deficiency of which causes emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy, is localized at the inner nuclear membrane.;x-linked recessive emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( edmd ) is an inherited muscle disorder characterized by the clinical triad of progressive wasting of humero-peroneal muscles , early contractures of the elbows , achilles tendons and postcervical muscles , and cardiac conduction block with a high risk of sudden death . the gene for edmd on xq28 encodes a novel protein named emerin that localizes at the nuclear membrane of skeletal , cardiac and smooth muscles and some other non-muscle tissues . to investigate a possible physiological role for emerin , we examined the ultrastructural localization of the protein in human skeletal muscle and hela cells , using ultrathin cryosections . we found that the immune-labeled colloidal gold particles were localized on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane , but not on the nuclear pore . emerin stayed on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear lamina , even after detergent treatment that solubilizes membrane lipids and washes out membrane proteins . these results suggest that emerin anchors at the inner nuclear membrane through the hydrophobic stretch , and protrudes from the hydrophilic region to the nucleoplasm where it interacts with the nuclear lamina . we speculate that emerin contributes to maintain the nuclear structure and stability , as well as nuclear functions , particularly in muscle tissues that have severe stress with rigorous contraction-relaxation movements and calcium flux . .;0;0;1;0

pilocarpine seizures cause age-dependent impairment in auditory location discrimination.;"children who have status epilepticus have continuous or rapidly repeating seizures that may be life-threatening and may cause life-long changes in brain and behavior. the extent to which status epilepticus causes deficits in auditory discrimination is unknown. a naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus. male sprague-dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day (p) 20, or a convulsant dose of pilocarpine on p20 or p45. pilocarpine on either day induced status epilepticus; status epilepticus at p45 resulted in ca3 cell loss and spontaneous seizures, whereas p20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous seizures. mature rats were trained with sound-source location and sound-silence discriminations. control (saline p20) rats acquired both discriminations immediately. in status epilepticus (p20) rats, acquisition of the sound-source location discrimination was moderately impaired. status epilepticus (p45) rats failed to acquire either sound-source location or sound-silence discriminations. status epilepticus in rat causes an age-dependent, long-term impairment in auditory discrimination. this impairment may explain one cause of impaired auditory location discrimination in humans.";0;0;1;0

brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.;anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs, but they frequently cause dose-related cardiotoxicity. the cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction. we measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) to determine whether bnp might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin (dnr)-containing regimen. thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a dnr-containing regimen. cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies. the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) and bnp were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography. three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. the plasma levels of bnp in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit (40 pg/ml) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography. on the other hand, bnp did not increase in the patients without heart failure given dnr, even at more than 700 mg/m(2). the plasma level of anp did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure. these preliminary results suggest that bnp may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.;1;0;1;1
prevention of seizures and reorganization of hippocampal functions by transplantation of bone marrow cells in the acute phase of experimental epilepsy.;in this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells (bmcs) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rats. bmcs obtained from green fluorescent protein (gfp) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of status epilepticus (se). spontaneous recurrent seizures (srs) were monitored using racine's seizure severity scale. all of the rats in the saline-treated epileptic control group developed srs, whereas none of the bmc-treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term (15 days after transplantation), regardless of the bmc source. over the long-term chronic phase (120 days after transplantation), only 25% of bmc-treated epileptic animals had seizures, but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group. the density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with bmcs was markedly preserved. at hippocampal schaeffer collateral-ca1 synapses, long-term potentiation was preserved in bmc-transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls. the donor-derived gfp(+) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rats. in conclusion, treatment with bmcs can prevent the development of chronic seizures, reduce neuronal loss, and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network.;0;0;1;0

patient tolerance study of topical chlorhexidine diphosphanilate: a new topical agent for burns.;"effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease infection and mortality in burn patients. chlorhexidine phosphanilate (chp), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, has been evaluated as a topical burn wound dressing in cream form, but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was painful upon application. this study compared various concentrations of chp to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy. twenty-nine burn patients, each with two similar burns which could be separately treated, were given pairs of treatments at successive 12-h intervals over a 3-day period. one burn site was treated with each of four different chp concentrations, from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent, their vehicle, and 1 per cent silver sulphadiazine (agsd) cream, an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn wounds. the other site was always treated with agsd cream. there was a direct relationship between chp concentration and patients' ratings of pain on an analogue scale. the 0.25 per cent chp cream was closest to agsd in pain tolerance; however, none of the treatments differed statistically from agsd or from each other. in addition, ease of application of chp creams was less satisfactory than that of agsd. it was concluded that formulations at or below 0.5 per cent chp may prove acceptable for wound care, but the vehicle system needs pharmaceutical improvement to render it more tolerable and easier to use.";0;0;1;0

acute cocaine-induced seizures: differential sensitivity of six inbred mouse strains.;mature male and female mice from six inbred stains were tested for susceptibility to behavioral seizures induced by a single injection of cocaine. cocaine was injected ip over a range of doses (50-100 mg/kg) and behavior was monitored for 20 minutes. seizure end points included latency to forelimb or hindlimb clonus, latency to clonic running seizure and latency to jumping bouncing seizure. a range of strain specific sensitivities was documented with a/j and sjl mice being most sensitive and c57bl/6j most resistant. dba/2j, balb/cbyj and nzw/lacj strains exhibited intermediate sensitivity. eeg recordings were made in sjl, a/j and c57bl/6j mice revealing a close correspondence between electrical activity and behavior. additionally, levels of cocaine determined in hippocampus and cortex were not different between sensitive and resistant strains. additional studies of these murine strains may be useful for investigating genetic influences on cocaine-induced seizures.;0;0;1;0
the effects of sevoflurane on lidocaine-induced convulsions.;the influence of sevoflurane on lidocaine-induced convulsions was studied in cats. the convulsive threshold (mean +/- sd) was 41.4 +/- 6.5 mg. l(-1) with lidocaine infusion (6 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)), increasing significantly to 66.6 +/- 10.9 mg. l(-1) when the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was 0.8%. however, the threshold (61.6 +/- 8.7 mg. l(-1)) during 1.6% sevoflurane was not significant from that during 0.8% sevoflurane, indicating a celling effect. there was no significant difference in the convulsive threshold between sevoflurane and enflurane. the rise in blood pressure became less marked when higher concentrations of sevoflurane or enflurane were administered and the blood pressure at convulsions decreased significantly in 1.6% sevoflurane, and in 0.8% and 1.6% enflurane. however, there was no significant difference in the lidocaine concentrations measured when the systolic blood pressure became 70 mmhg. apamin, a selective blocker of calcium-dependent potassium channels, was administered intracerebroventricularly in rats anesthetized with 0.8% sevoflurane to investigate the mechanism of the anticonvulsive effects. apamin (10 ng) had a tendency to decrease the convulsive threshold (21.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.9 +/- 2.5 mg. l(-1)) but this was not statistically significant. it is suggested that sevoflurane reduces the convulsive effect of lidocaine toxicity but carries some risk due to circulatory depression.;1;0;0;0

overgrowth of oral mucosa and facial skin, a novel feature of aspartylglucosaminuria.;aspartylglucosaminuria ( agu ) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase ( aga ) . the main symptom is progressive mental retardation . a spectrum of different mutations has been reported in this disease , one missense mutation ( cys163ser ) being responsible for the majority of finnish cases . we were able to examine 66 finnish agu patients for changes in the oral mucosa and 44 of these for changes in facial skin . biopsy specimens of 16 oral lesions , 12 of them associated with the teeth , plus two facial lesions were studied histologically . immunohistochemical staining for aga was performed on 15 oral specimens . skin was seborrhoeic in adolescent and adult patients , with erythema of the facial skin already common in childhood . of 44 patients , nine ( 20 % ) had facial angiofibromas , tumours primarily occurring in association with tuberous sclerosis . oedemic buccal mucosa ( leucoedema ) and gingival overgrowths were more frequent in agu patients than in controls ( p oral mucosal lesions studied histologically , 15 represented fibroepithelial or epithelial hyperplasias and were reactive in nature . cytoplasmic vacuolisation was evident in four . immunohistochemically , expression of aga in agu patients mucosal lesions did not differ from that seen in corresponding lesions of normal subjects . thus , the high frequency of mucosal overgrowth in agu patients does not appear to be directly associated with lysosomal storage or with alterations in the level of aga expression .;0;0;0;1
epinephrine dysrhythmogenicity is not enhanced by subtoxic bupivacaine in dogs.;since bupivacaine and epinephrine may both precipitate dysrhythmias, circulating bupivacaine during regional anesthesia could potentiate dysrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine. we therefore examined whether bupivacaine alters the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent administration of epinephrine in conscious, healthy dogs and in anesthetized dogs with myocardial infarction. forty-one conscious dogs received 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine. seventeen animals responded with ventricular tachycardia (vt) within 3 min. after 3 h, these responders randomly received 1 or 2 mg/kg bupivacaine or saline over 5 min, followed by 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine. in the bupivacaine groups, epinephrine caused fewer prodysrhythmic effects than without bupivacaine. vt appeared in fewer dogs and at a later time, and there were more sinoatrial beats and less ectopies. epinephrine shortened qt less after bupivacaine than in control animals. one day after experimental myocardial infarction, six additional halothane-anesthetized dogs received 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine until vt appeared. after 45 min, 1 mg/kg bupivacaine was injected over 5 min, again followed by 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine. in these dogs, the prodysrhythmic response to epinephrine was also mitigated by preceding bupivacaine. bupivacaine antagonizes epinephrine dysrhythmogenicity in conscious dogs susceptible to vt and in anesthetized dogs with spontaneous postinfarct dysrhythmias. there is no evidence that systemic subtoxic bupivacaine administration enhances the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent epinephrine.;1;0;1;0
the role of nitric oxide in convulsions induced by lindane in rats.;lindane is an organochloride pesticide and scabicide. it evokes convulsions mainly trough the blockage of gaba(a) receptors. nitric oxide (no), gaseous neurotransmitter, has contradictor role in epileptogenesis due to opposite effects of l-arginine, precursor of no syntheses (nos), and l-name (nos inhibitor) observed in different epilepsy models. the aim of the current study was to determine the effects of no on the behavioral and eeg characteristics of lindane-induced epilepsy in male wistar albino rats. the administration of l-arginine (600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) in dose-dependent manner significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convulsion elicited by lower lindane dose (4 mg/kg, i.p.). on the contrary, pretreatment with l-name (500, 700 and 900 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased convulsion incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to convulsion following injection with a convulsive dose of lindane (8 mg/kg, i.p.). eeg analyses showed increase of number and duration of ictal periods in eeg of rats receiving l-arginine prior to lindane and decrease of this number in rats pretreated with l-name. these results support the conclusion that no plays a role of endogenous convulsant in rat model of lindane seizures.;0;0;1;0
deficit of in vivo mitochondrial atp production in patients with friedreich ataxia.;friedreich ataxia ( frda ) , the most common of the inherited ataxias , is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder , characterized clinically by onset before the age of 25 of progressive gait and limb ataxia , absence of deep tendon reflexes , extensor plantar responses , and loss of position and vibration sense in the lower limbs . frda is caused by a gaa triplet expansion in the first intron of the frda gene on chromosome 9q13 in 97 % of patients . the frda gene encodes a widely expressed 210-aa protein , frataxin , which is located in mitochondria and is severely reduced in frda patients . frataxin function is still unknown but the knockout of the yeast frataxin homologue gene ( yfh1 ) showed a severe defect of mitochondrial respiration and loss of mtdna associated with elevated intramitochondrial iron . here we report in vivo evidence of impaired mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle of frda patients . using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy we demonstrated a maximum rate of muscle mitochondrial atp production ( v ( max ) ) below the normal range in all 12 frda patients and a strong negative correlation between mitochondrial v ( max ) and the number of gaa repeats in the smaller allele . our results show that frda is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial disorder affecting oxidative phosphorylation and give a rationale for treatments aimed to improve mitochondrial function in this condition . .;0;0;1;0

association of nitric oxide production and apoptosis in a model of experimental nephropathy.;"background: in recent studies increased amounts of nitric oxide (no) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney. we have studied the role of no and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin (adr). methods: the alteration in the no pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum/urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney (iprk) system. rats were stratified into control groups and adr-induced nephropathy groups. these two groups were then divided into: group 1, animals receiving saline; and group 2, animals receiving aminoguanidine (ag) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible-no synthase. on day 21, rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis. results: histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with adr revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation. they also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups (p < 0.05). urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the adr-nephropathy group (p < 0.05). in the iprk phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the adr-nephropathy group. apoptosis was not detected in controls. however, in the adr-nephropathy group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas. double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ed1, a marker for monocytes/macrophages. treatment with ag prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control levels. conclusion: we suggest that interactions between no and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the adr-induced nephrosis.";0;1;0;0

the von hippel-lindau tumor suppressor gene product interacts with sp1 to repress vascular endothelial growth factor promoter activity.;the von hippel-lindau tumor suppressor gene ( vhl ) has a critical role in the pathogenesis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) , as vhl mutations have been found in both von hippel-lindau disease-associated and sporadic rccs . recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) mrna is upregulated in rcc- and von hippel-lindau disease-associated tumors . we have therefore assessed the effect of the vhl gene product on vegf expression . vegf promoter-luciferase constructs were transiently cotransfected with a wild-type vhl ( wt-vhl ) vector in several cell lines , including 293 embryonic kidney and rcc cell lines . wt-vhl protein inhibited vegf promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 5- to 10-fold . deletion analysis defined a 144-bp region of the vegf promoter necessary for vhl repression . this vhl-responsive element is gc rich and specifically binds the transcription factor sp1 in crude nuclear extracts . in drosophila cells , cotransfected vhl represses sp1-mediated activation but not basal activity of the vegf promoter . we next demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitates that vhl and sp1 were part of the same complex and , by using a glutathione-s-transferase-vhl fusion protein and purified sp1 , that vhl and sp1 directly interact . furthermore , endogenous vegf mrna levels were suppressed in permanent rcc cell lines expressing wt-vhl , and nuclear run-on studies indicated that vhl regulation of vegf occurs at least partly at the transcriptional level . these observations support a new mechanism for vhl-mediated transcriptional repression via a direct inhibitory action on sp1 and suggest that loss of sp1 inhibition may be important in the pathogenesis of von hippel-lindau disease and rcc . .;0;1;0;1

the emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy protein, emerin, is a nuclear membrane protein.;a large fragment of emerin cdna was prepared by pcr and expressed as a recombinant protein in escherichia coli . using this as immunogen , we prepared a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies which recognise at least four different epitopes on emerin in order to ensure that emerin can be distinguished from non-specific cross-reacting proteins . all the mabs recognised a 34 kda protein in all tissues tested , though minor emerin-related bands were also detected in some tissues . immunofluorescence microscopy showed that emerin is located at the nuclear rim in all tissues examined . a muscle biopsy from an emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( emdm ) patient showed complete absence of emerin by both western blotting and immunohistochemistry , suggesting a simple diagnostic antibody test for edmd families . biochemical fractionation of brain and liver tissues showed that emerin was present in nuclei purified by centrifugation through 65 % sucrose and was absent from soluble fractions ( post-100 , 000 g ) . from these results , together with sequence and structural homologies between emerin , thymopoietins and the nuclear lamina-associated protein , lap2 , we suggest that emerin will prove to be one member of a family of inner nuclear membrane proteins . .;0;1;1;0

can lidocaine reduce succinylcholine induced postoperative myalgia?;"this study was undertaken to determine the effect of lidocaine pretreatment on reduction of succinylcholine-induced myalgia in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. one hundred and thirty-five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective, double blind, randomized manner. group ps, the control group, received normal saline and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); group ls, lidocaine 1.5 mg x kg(-1) and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); group pr, normal saline and rocuronium 0.6 mg x kg(-1). morphine 0.1 mg x kg(-1) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, ecg and pulse oximetry. anesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg(-1) thiopental iv. followed by succinylcholine (group ps, ls) or rocuronium (group pr) for tracheal intubation. following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered. the blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions. twenty-four hours later, any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management. the results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in group pr while the patients in group ls had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in group ps (p < 0.001). at 24 h, the incidence of myalgia was higher in group ps than in group ls and pr (p < 0.05). a correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation. the changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups. in conclusion, where succinylcholine is used, lidocaine is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of postoperative myalgia.";1;0;0;0

cyclosporine and tacrolimus-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.;the development of thrombotic microangiopathy (tma) associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented. treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange, plasma infusion, anticoagulation, and intravenous immunoglobulin g infusion. however, for recipients of organ transplantation, removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss. the last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine. as a result, switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine-induced tma. with the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation, tacrolimus-associated tma has also been recognized. however, literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of tma in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited. we report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine-induced tma that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy. introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of tma and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft. patients who are switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent tma.;0;1;1;0

tachyphylaxis to systemic but not to airway responses during prolonged therapy with high dose inhaled salbutamol in asthmatics.;high doses of inhaled salbutamol produce substantial improvements in airway response in patients with asthma, and are associated with dose-dependent systemic beta-adrenoceptor responses. the purpose of the present study was to investigate whether tachyphylaxis occurs during prolonged treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol. twelve asthmatic patients (fev1, 81 +/- 4% predicted), requiring only occasional inhaled beta-agonists as their sole therapy, were given a 14-day treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol (hds), 4,000 micrograms daily, low dose inhaled salbutamol (lds), 800 micrograms daily, or placebo (pi) by metered-dose inhaler in a double-blind, randomized crossover design. during the 14-day run-in and during washout periods, inhaled beta-agonists were withheld and ipratropium bromide was substituted for rescue purposes. at the end of each 14-day treatment, a dose-response curve (drc) was performed, and airway (fev1, fef25-75) chronotropic (hr), tremor, and metabolic (k, glu) responses were measured at each step (from 100 to 4,000 micrograms). treatment had no significant effect on baseline values. there were dose-dependent increases in fev1 and fef25-75 (p less than 0.001), and pretreatment with hds did not displace the drc to the right. drc for hr (p less than 0.001), k (p less than 0.001), and glu (p less than 0.005) were attenuated after treatment with hds compared with pi. there were also differences between hds and lds for hr (p less than 0.001) and glu (p less than 0.05) responses. frequency and severity of subjective adverse effects were also reduced after hds: tremor (p less than 0.001), palpitations (p less than 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words);0;0;1;0

localization of human brca1 and its loss in high-grade, non-inherited breast carcinomas.;although the link between the brca1 tumour-suppressor gene and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer is established , the role , if any , of brca1 in non-familial cancers is unclear . brca1 mutations are rare in sporadic cancers , but loss of brca1 resulting from reduced expression or incorrect subcellular localization is postulated to be important in non-familial breast and ovarian cancers . epigenetic loss , however , has not received general acceptance due to controversy regarding the subcellular localization of brca1 proteins , reports of which have ranged from exclusively nuclear , to conditionally nuclear , to the er / golgi , to cytoplasmic invaginations into the nucleus . in an attempt to resolve this issue , we have comprehensively characterized 19 anti-brca1 antibodies . these reagents detect a 220-kd protein localized in discrete nuclear foci in all epithelial cell lines , including those derived from breast malignancies . immunohistochemical staining of human breast specimens also revealed brca1 nuclear foci in benign breast , invasive lobular cancers and low-grade ductal carcinomas . conversely , brca1 expression was reduced or undetectable in the majority of high-grade , ductal carcinomas , suggesting that absence of brca1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of a significant percentage of sporadic breast cancers . .;0;0;0;1

vinorelbine-related cardiac events: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.;"several cases of cardiac adverse reactions related to vinorelbine (vnr) have been reported in the literature. in order to quantify the incidence of these cardiac events, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing vnr with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various malignancies. randomized clinical trials comparing vnr with other drugs in the treatment of cancer were searched in medline, embase, evidence-based medicine reviews databases and the cochrane library from 1987 to 2002. outcomes of interest were severe cardiac events, toxic deaths and cardiac event-related deaths reported in each publication. we found 19 trials, involving 2441 patients treated by vnr and 2050 control patients. the incidence of cardiac events with vnr was 1.19% [95% confidence interval (ci) (0.75; 1.67)]. there was no difference in the risk of cardiac events between vnr and other drugs [odds ratio: 0.92, 95% ci (0.54; 1.55)]. the risk of vnr cardiac events was similar to vindesine (vds) and other cardiotoxic drugs [fluorouracil, anthracyclines, gemcitabine (gem) em leader ]. even if it did not reach statistical significance because of a few number of cases, the risk was lower in trials excluding patients with cardiac history, and seemed to be higher in trials including patients with pre-existing cardiac diseases. vinorelbine-related cardiac events concern about 1% of treated patients in clinical trials. however, the risk associated with vnr seems to be similar to that of other chemotherapeutic agents in the same indications.";1;0;1;1
chromosome breakage in the prader-willi and angelman syndromes involves recombination between large, transcribed repeats at proximal and distal breakpoints.;prader-willi syndrome ( pws ) and angelman syndrome ( as ) are distinct neurobehavioral disorders that most often arise from a 4-mb deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis , respectively . at a de novo frequency of approximately . 67-1 / 10 , 000 births , these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome . to elucidate the mechanism underlying these events , we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster . novel dna sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from yacs within or near these regions . analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids , yac contigs , and fish of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences ( the end repeats ) at or near the breakpoints . the end-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene ( herc2 ) , many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues . one of five pws / as patients analyzed to date has an identifiable , rearranged herc2 transcript derived from the deletion event . we postulate that the end repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion . furthermore , we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process .;0;0;1;0

preferential germline mutation of the paternal allele in retinoblastoma.;the event triggering malignant proliferation in 70 % of retinoblastoma tumours is loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 13q14 , whereby the normal retinoblastoma gene ( rb1 ) allele is lost and an already mutated rb1 allele remains in the tumour . the first allele suffers a mutational event--deletion , duplication or point mutation ( manuscript in preparation ) --either in the germ line ( all bilateral patients ) or in a somatic retinal cell ( most unilateral patients ) . most bilateral patients have no family history of retinoblastoma and are presumed to have new germline mutations which arose in the egg , sperm or early embryo . we have determined the parental origin of the retained allele in nine retinoblastoma tumours from eight unrelated non-familial cases by using rb1-linked genetic markers . six tumours retained the paternal allele and three retained the maternal allele . of the three unilateral tumours , only one retained the paternal rb1 allele . thus , there is no evidence that the paternal rb1 allele is preferentially retained in retinoblastoma , as has been suggested to be the case in osteosarcoma . by contrast , tumours from four of the five bilateral patients retained the paternal rb1 allele . this suggests either that new germline rb1 mutations arise more frequently during spermatogenesis than during oogenesis , or that imprinting in the early embryo affects chromosomal susceptibility to mutation . .;0;0;0;1
role of mangiferin on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.;the current study dealt with the protective role of mangiferin, a polyphenol from mangifera indica linn. (anacardiaceae), on isoproterenol (isph)-induced myocardial infarction (mi) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism. subcutaneous injection of isph (200 mg/kg body weight in 1 ml saline) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused myocardial damage in rat heart, which was determined by the increased activity of serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes (ck-mb), increased uric acid level and reduced plasma iron binding capacity. the protective role of mangiferin was analyzed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (ttc) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the ischemic myocardium. the heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase activities, non-enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin, vitamin c, vitamin e and glutathione levels were altered in mi rats. upon pretreatment with mangiferin (100 mg/kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to mi rats protected the above-mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels. activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non-enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon mangiferin administration as compared to isph-induced mi rats. from the present study it is concluded that mangiferin exerts a beneficial effect against isph-induced mi due to its antioxidant potential, which regulated the tissues defense system against cardiac damage.;1;0;0;0

cerebral blood flow and metabolism during isoflurane-induced hypotension in patients subjected to surgery for cerebral aneurysms.;cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were measured during isoflurane-induced hypotension in 10 patients subjected to craniotomy for clipping of a cerebral aneurysm. flow and metabolism were measured 5-13 days after the subarachnoid haemorrhage by a modification of the classical kety-schmidt technique using xenon-133 i.v. anaesthesia was maintained with an inspired isoflurane concentration of 0.75% (plus 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen), during which cbf and cmro2 were 34.3 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g min-1 and 2.32 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1 at paco2 4.1 +/- 0.1 kpa (mean +/- sem). controlled hypotension to an average map of 50-55 mm hg was induced by increasing the dose of isoflurane, and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2.2 +/- 0.2%. this resulted in a significant decrease in cmro2 (to 1.73 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1), while cbf was unchanged. after the clipping of the aneurysm the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 0.75%. there was a significant increase in cbf, although cmro2 was unchanged, compared with pre-hypotensive values. these changes might offer protection to brain tissue during periods of induced hypotension.;0;0;1;0
arterial hypertension as a complication of prolonged ketoconazole treatment.;two of 14 patients with cushing's syndrome treated on a long-term basis with ketoconazole developed sustained hypertension. in both cases normal plasma and urinary free cortisol levels had been achieved following ketoconazole therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment. in patient 1, plasma levels of deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol were elevated. in patient 2, in addition to an increase in both deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol levels, plasma aldosterone values were raised, with a concomitant suppression of renin levels. our findings show that long-term treatment with high doses of ketoconazole may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid-related hypertension.;1;0;0;0

autosomal recessive familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus with continued secretion of mutant weakly active vasopressin.;familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by post-natal development of arginine vasopressin ( avp ) deficiency due to mutations in the avp gene . all published mutations affect the signal peptide or the neurophysin-ii carrier protein and are presumed to interfere with processing of the preprohormone , leading to neuronal damage . we studied an unusual palestinian family consisting of asymptomatic first cousin parents and three children affected with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus , suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance . all three affected children were homozygous and the parents heterozygous for a single novel mutation ( c301- > t ) in exon 1 , replacing pro7 of mature avp with leu ( leu-avp ) . leu-avp was a weak agonist with approximately 30-fold reduced binding to the human v2 receptor . measured by radioimmunoassay with a synthetic leu-avp standard , serum leu-avp levels were elevated in all three children and further increased during water deprivation to as high as 30 times normal . the youngest child ( 2 years old ) was only mildly affected but had leu-avp levels similar to her severely affected 8-year-old brother , suggesting that unknown mechanisms may partially compensate for a deficiency of active avp in very young children . .;0;0;1;0
standard operating procedures for antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of acute kidney injury: a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study.;"introduction: acute kidney injury (aki) occurs in 7% of hospitalized and 66% of intensive care unit (icu) patients. it increases mortality, hospital length of stay, and costs. the aim of this study was to investigate, whether there is an association between adherence to guidelines (standard operating procedures (sop)) for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics and the occurrence of aki. methods: this study was carried out as a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study. data collection was performed over a total of 170 days in three icus at charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin. a total of 675 patients were included; 163 of these had therapy with vancomycin, gentamicin, or tobramycin; were >18 years; and treated in the icu for >24 hours. patients with an adherence to sop >70% were classified into the high adherence group (hag) and patients with an adherence of <70% into the low adherence group (lag). aki was defined according to rifle criteria. adherence to sops was evaluated by retrospective expert audit. development of aki was compared between groups with exact chi2-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis (two-sided p <0.05). results: lag consisted of 75 patients (46%) versus 88 hag patients (54%). aki occurred significantly more often in lag with 36% versus 21% in hag (p = 0.035). basic characteristics were comparable, except an increased rate of soft tissue infections in lag. multivariate analysis revealed an odds ratio of 2.5-fold for lag to develop aki compared with hag (95% confidence interval 1.195 to 5.124, p = 0.039). conclusion: low adherence to sops for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics was associated with a higher occurrence of aki. trial registration: current controlled trials isrctn54598675. registered 17 august 2007.";0;1;0;0
long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.;"background: hormone therapy (ht) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms. it has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational. objectives: to assess the effect of long-term ht on mortality, heart disease, venous thromboembolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gallbladder disease, cognitive function, dementia, fractures and quality of life. search strategy: we searched the following databases up to november 2004: the cochrane menstrual disorders and subfertility group trials register, cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), medline, embase, biological abstracts. relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched. selection criteria: randomised double-blind trials of ht (oestrogens with or without progestogens) versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. data collection and analysis: fifteen rcts were included. trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently. they calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes. main results: all the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials. in relatively healthy women, combined continuous ht significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after 3 years), breast cancer (after 5 years) and gallbladder disease. long-term oestrogen-only ht also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease. overall, the only statistically significant benefits of ht were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long-term use. among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined ht, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous ht significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism. no trials focussed specifically on younger women. however, one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year-old women taking combined continuous ht and 1637 taking oestrogen-only ht, versus similar-sized placebo groups. the only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous ht; their absolute risk remained very low. authors' conclusions: ht is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. we need more evidence on the safety of ht for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.";1;0;1;1

metallothionein induction reduces caspase-3 activity and tnfalpha levels with preservation of cognitive function and intact hippocampal neurons in carmustine-treated rats.;hippocampal integrity is essential for cognitive functions. on the other hand, induction of metallothionein (mt) by znso(4) and its role in neuroprotection has been documented. the present study aimed to explore the effect of mt induction on carmustine (bcnu)-induced hippocampal cognitive dysfunction in rats. a total of 60 male wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (15/group): the control group injected with single doses of normal saline (i.c.v) followed 24 h later by bcnu solvent (i.v). the second group administered znso(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v, once) then bcnu solvent (i.v) after 24 h. third group received bcnu (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) 24 h after injection with normal saline (i.c.v). fourth group received a single dose of znso(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v) then bcnu (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) after 24 h. the obtained data revealed that bcnu administration resulted in deterioration of learning and short-term memory (stm), as measured by using radial arm water maze, accompanied with decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase (gr) activity and reduced glutathione (gsh) content. also, bcnu administration increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha), hippocampal mt and malondialdehyde (mda) contents as well as caspase-3 activity in addition to histological alterations. znso(4) pretreatment counteracted bcnu-induced inhibition of gr and depletion of gsh and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of mda and tnfalpha as well as the activity of caspase-3. the histological features were improved in hippocampus of rats treated with znso(4) + bcnu compared to only bcnu-treated animals. in conclusion, mt induction halts bcnu-induced hippocampal toxicity as it prevented gr inhibition and gsh depletion and counteracted the increased levels of tnfalpha, mda and caspase-3 activity with subsequent preservation of cognition.;0;0;1;1

localisation of the myotonic dystrophy locus to 19q13.;2-19q13.3 and its relationship to twelve polymorphic loci on 19q. the order of fourteen polymorphic markers localised to the long arm of human chromosome 19 has been established by multipoint mapping in a set of 40 ceph ( centre detude de polymorphisme humain , paris ) reference families . we report here the linkage relationship of the myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) locus to twelve of these markers as studied in 45 families with dm . the resulting genetic map is supported by the localisation of the dna markers in a panel of somatic cell hybrids . ten of the twelve markers have been shown to be proximal to the dm gene and two , prkcg and d19s22 , distal but at distances of approximately 25 cm and 15 cm , respectively . the closest proximal markers are apoc2 ( apolipoprotein c-ii ) and ckm ( creatine kinase , muscle ) approximately 3 cm and 2 cm from the dm gene respectively , in the order apoc2-ckm-dm . the distance between apoc2 , ckm and dm ( of the order of 2 million base pairs ) and their known orientation should permit directional chromosome walking and jumping . the data presented here should enable us to determine whether or not new markers are distal to apoc2 / ckm and thus potentially flank the dm gene . .;0;0;1;0
long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.;background: hormone therapy (ht) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. this is an updated version of the original cochrane review first published in 2005. objectives: to assess the effect of long-term ht on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life. search strategy: we searched the following databases to november 2007: trials register of the cochrane menstrual disorders and subfertility group, cochrane central register of controlled trials, medline, embase, biological abstracts. also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts. selection criteria: randomised double-blind trials of ht versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. ht included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. data collection and analysis: two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. main results: nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. in relatively healthy women, combined continuous ht significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease. long-term oestrogen-only ht significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. the only statistically significant benefits of ht were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined ht) colon cancer, with long-term use. among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined ht, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous ht significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism.one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous ht and 1637 taking oestrogen-only ht, versus similar-sized placebo groups. the only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo-embolism in women taking combined continuous ht: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. however, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. authors' conclusions: ht is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. we need more evidence on the safety of ht for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.;1;0;1;1
neuropsychiatric side effects after the use of mefloquine.;this study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with mefloquine. reactions consisted mainly of seizures, acute psychoses, anxiety neurosis, and major disturbances of sleep-wake rhythm. side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to severe. in a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in germany, it is estimated that one of 8,000 mefloquine users suffers from such reactions. the incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions, compared with one of 13,000 in the prophylaxis group, making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after mefloquine treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis. therefore, certain limitations for malaria prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine are recommended.;0;0;1;0

illegitimate transcription of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in lymphocytes for identification of mutations in phenylketonuria.;taking advantage of the illegitimate transcription of the phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) gene , we have been able to analyse the pah cdna sequence of hyperphenylalaninemic children in circulating lymphocytes . using this approach , we have also identified 3 novel mutations in cdna from liver and lymphocytes of two patients . one mutation , detected by the abnormal pattern of migration of an amplified fragment , is a c to t transition in the splice acceptor site of intron 10 , which resulted in the skipping of exon 11 with the premature termination of rna translation downstream from exon 12 ( -3 ivs10 ) . the other two mutations are missense mutations in exons 10 and 11 ( respectively , l333f and e390g ) . the present study supports the view that circulating lymphocytes give easy access to pah gene transcripts whose nucleotide sequence is identical to that reported in liver and therefore represent a useful tool for molecular genetic studies in phenylketonuria . .;0;1;0;0

the selective 5-ht6 receptor antagonist ro4368554 restores memory performance in cholinergic and serotonergic models of memory deficiency in the rat.;antagonists at serotonin type 6 (5-ht(6)) receptors show activity in models of learning and memory. although the underlying mechanism(s) are not well understood, these effects may involve an increase in acetylcholine (ach) levels. the present study sought to characterize the cognitive-enhancing effects of the 5-ht(6) antagonist ro4368554 (3-benzenesulfonyl-7-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)1h-indole) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic (scopolamine pretreatment) and a serotonergic- (tryptophan (trp) depletion) deficient model, and compared its pattern of action with that of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor metrifonate. initial testing in a time-dependent forgetting task employing a 24-h delay between training and testing showed that metrifonate improved object recognition (at 10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.), whereas ro4368554 was inactive. both, ro4368554 (3 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and metrifonate (10 mg/kg, p.o., respectively) reversed memory deficits induced by scopolamine and trp depletion (10 mg/kg, i.p., and 3 mg/kg, p.o., respectively). in conclusion, although ro4368554 did not improve a time-related retention deficit, it reversed a cholinergic and a serotonergic memory deficit, suggesting that both mechanisms may be involved in the facilitation of object memory by ro4368554 and, possibly, other 5-ht(6) receptor antagonists.;0;0;1;0
localisation of the becker muscular dystrophy gene on the short arm of the x chromosome by linkage to cloned dna sequences.;a linkage study in 30 becker muscular dystrophy ( bmd ) kindreds using three cloned dna sequences from the x chromosome which demonstrate restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( rflps ) , suggests that the bmd gene is located on the short arm of the x chromosome , in the p21 region . the genes for becker and duchenne dystrophies must therefore be closely linked , if not allelic , and any future dna probes found to be of practical use in one disorder should be equally applicable to the other . the linkage analysis also provides data on the frequency of recombination along the short arm of the x chromosome , and across the centromeric region . .;0;0;1;0
disulfiram-induced transient optic and peripheral neuropathy: a case report.;aim: to report a case of optic and peripheral neuropathy after chronic use of disulfiram for alcohol dependence management. materials and methods: a case report. results: a 57-year-old male presented with gradual loss of vision in both eyes with intermittent headaches for 2 months. he also complained of paraesthesia with numbness in both feet. his vision was 6/15 and 2/60 in the right and left eyes, respectively. fundoscopy revealed bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads. visual field testing confirmed bilateral central-caecal scotomata. he had been taking disulfiram for alcohol dependence for the preceding 3 years. disulfiram discontinuation lead to an immediate symptomatic improvement. conclusion: physicians initiating long-term disulfiram therapy should be aware of these adverse effects. they should recommend annual ophthalmic reviews with visual field testing. patients should be reassured with respect to the reversibility of these adverse effects.;0;0;1;0
neutrophil superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in patients with acute liver failure.;defects in superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production may be implicated in the high incidence of bacterial infections in patients with acute liver failure (alf). in the present study, oxygen radical production in patients with alf due to paracetamol overdose was compared with that of healthy volunteers. neutrophils from 14 alf patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with alf or control serum. superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by alf neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with alf serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects (p < 0.01). this defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used (p < 0.05). superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in neutrophils stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmlp) from a further 18 alf patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils. serum c3 complement levels were significantly reduced in alf patients compared with control subjects (p < 0.0005). these results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in alf due to paracetamol overdose, that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement, possibly connected to the complement receptor.;0;1;0;0

induction by paracetamol of bladder and liver tumours in the rat. effects on hepatocyte fine structure.;groups of male and female inbred leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0.5% or 1.0% paracetamol by weight for up to 18 months. at the 1.0% dosage level, 20% of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver, a statistically significant incidence. these rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration, the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats. papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol-treated groups, and three rats bore bladder carcinomas. however, significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males. additionally, 20 to 25% of paracetamol-treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi. a low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding. an electron microscope study of the livers of paracetamol-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcinogens.;0;1;0;1

expression of the murine duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in muscle and brain.;complementary dna clones were isolated that represent the 5 terminal 2 . 5 kilobases of the murine duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) messenger rna ( mrna ) . mouse dmd mrna was detectable in skeletal and cardiac muscle and at a level approximately 90 percent lower in brain . dmd mrna is also present , but at much lower than normal levels , in both the muscle and brain of three different strains of dystrophic mdx mice . the identification of dmd mrna in brain raises the possibility of a relation between human duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) gene expression and the mental retardation found in some dmd males . these results also provide evidence that the mdx mutations are allelic variants of mouse dmd gene mutations .;0;0;1;0
development of isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.;the development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol (iso) (0.3 mg/kg body weight). a time course was established for the change in tissue mass, rna and dna content, as well as hydroxyproline content. heart weight increased 44% after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3.4 days. ventricular rna content was elevated 26% after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy. the half time for rna accumulation was 2.0 days. the total content of hydroxyproline remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46% after 4 days of therapy. ventricular dna content was unchanged during the early stage (1-4 days) of hypertrophic growth but increased to a new steady-state level 19% above the controls after 8 days of treatment. intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed hypertrophy. however, dp/dt in the iso-treated hearts was slightly but significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated. these data indicate that the adaptive response to iso shows an early hypertrophic phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in rna content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in dna. however, prolonged stimulation (8-12 days) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia within the heart.;1;0;0;0

drug-associated acute-onset vanishing bile duct and stevens-johnson syndromes in a child.;"acute vanishing bile duct syndrome is a rare but established cause of progressive cholestasis in adults, is most often drug or toxin related, and is of unknown pathogenesis. it has not been reported previously in children. stevens-johnson syndrome is a well-recognized immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that affects all age groups, is drug or infection induced, and has classic systemic, mucosal, and dermatologic manifestations. a previously healthy child who developed acute, severe, rapidly progressive vanishing bile duct syndrome shortly after stevens-johnson syndrome is described; this was temporally associated with ibuprofen use. despite therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid, prednisone, and then tacrolimus, her cholestatic disease was unrelenting, with cirrhosis shown by biopsy 6 months after presentation. this case documents acute drug-related vanishing bile duct syndrome in the pediatric age group and suggests shared immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both stevens-johnson syndrome and vanishing bile duct syndrome.";0;1;1;0
erythropoietin restores the anemia-induced reduction in cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in rat tumors.;the aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuepo) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental tumors. anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration. in a second group, the development of anemia was prevented by rhuepo (1000 iu/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before carboplatin application. four days after carboplatin treatment, tumors (ds-sarcoma of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. neither carboplatin nor rhuepo treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se. when tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed. in the anemia group, the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls (13.3 days versus 8.6 days). in the group where anemia was prevented by rhuepo treatment, growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days). these results suggest that chemotherapy-induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors, whereas correction of anemia by rhuepo treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue.;0;0;0;1
tonic dopaminergic stimulation impairs associative learning in healthy subjects.;endogenous dopamine plays a central role in salience coding during associative learning. administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa enhances learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients. because levodopa increases both phasic and tonic dopaminergic neurotransmission, the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is unresolved. we here probed how selective tonic dopaminergic stimulation affects associative learning. forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete nouns over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. subjects received the tonically stimulating dopamine-receptor agonist pergolide (0.1 mg) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day. the dopamine agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to placebo. this learning decrement persisted up to the last follow-up 4 weeks post-training. subjects treated with pergolide also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the placebo group. the extent of 'flattened' affect with pergolide was related to the degree of learning inhibition. these findings suggest that tonic occupation of dopamine receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic dopamine signals. thus, phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which dopamine enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients.;0;0;1;0
phenobarbitone-induced enlargement of the liver in the rat: its relationship to carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis.;"the yield of severe cirrhosis of the liver (defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology, ascites greater than 30 ml, plasma albumin less than 2.2 g/dl, splenomegaly 2-3 times normal, and testicular atrophy approximately half normal weight) after 12 doses of carbon tetrachloride given intragastrically in the phenobarbitone-primed rat was increased from 25% to 56% by giving the initial ""calibrating"" dose of carbon tetrachloride at the peak of the phenobarbitone-induced enlargement of the liver. at this point it was assumed that the cytochrome p450/ccl4 toxic state was both maximal and stable. the optimal rat size to begin phenobarbitone was determined as 100 g, and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47% greater than normal rats of the same body weight. the optimal time for the initial dose of carbon tetrachloride was after 14 days on phenobarbitone.";0;1;0;0

aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the u.s. preventive services task force.;"background: coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the united states. in 2002, the u.s. preventive services task force (uspstf) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease. purpose: to determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and death. data sources: medline and cochrane library (search dates, 1 january 2001 to 28 august 2008), recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and suggestions from experts. study selection: english-language randomized, controlled trials (rcts); case-control studies; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (cvd) were selected to answer the following questions: does aspirin decrease coronary heart events, strokes, death from coronary heart events or stroke, or all-cause mortality in adults without known cvd? does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes? data extraction: all studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined uspstf criteria. data synthesis: new evidence from 1 good-quality rct, 1 good-quality meta-analysis, and 2 fair-quality subanalyses of rcts demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of cvd events in patients without known cvd. men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes. aspirin does not seem to affect cvd mortality or all-cause mortality in either men or women. the use of aspirin for primary prevention increases the risk for major bleeding events, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding events, in both men and women. men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes with aspirin use. a new rct and meta-analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic strokes in women is not statistically significantly increased. limitations: new evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of cvd is limited. the dose of aspirin used in the rcts varied, which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention. several of the rcts were conducted within populations of health professionals, which potentially limits generalizability. conclusion: aspirin reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in men and strokes in women. aspirin use increases the risk for serious bleeding events.";1;0;1;0

curcumin prevents maleate-induced nephrotoxicity: relation to hemodynamic alterations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex i.;the potential protective effect of the dietary antioxidant curcumin (120 mg/kg/day for 6 days) against the renal injury induced by maleate was evaluated. tubular proteinuria and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of maleate (400 mg/kg) in rats. maleate-induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) and n-acetyl b-d-glucosaminidase (nag), upregulation of kidney injury molecule (kim)-1, decrease in renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h. oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal nrf2 levels. studies were also conducted in renal epithelial llc-pk1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups. maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species (ros) production in llc-pk1 cells in culture. in addition, maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in adp-stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using malate/glutamate as substrate. the activities of both complex i and aconitase were also diminished. all the above-described alterations were prevented by curcumin. it is concluded that curcumin is able to attenuate in vivo maleate-induced nephropathy and in vitro cell damage. the in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex i, and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ros production.;0;1;0;0
does hormone therapy for the treatment of breast cancer have a detrimental effect on memory and cognition? a pilot study.;this pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for breast cancer affects cognition. patients participating in a randomised trial of anastrozole, tamoxifen alone or combined (atac) (n=94) and a group of women without breast cancer (n=35) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures. compared with the control group, the patients were impaired on a processing speed task (p=0.032) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory (p=0.026) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups. patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity. the results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer. verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in oestrogen levels, a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women. in view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly.;0;0;1;1
transient contralateral rotation following unilateral substantia nigra lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amphetamine.;following unilateral 6-ohda induced sn lesion, a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling. in order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on amphetamine-induced rotational behavior. three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion. such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration-induced breakdown of the da pool, or lesion-induced increase of da turnover in the spared neurons. a substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation. however, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, amphetamine dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), amphetamine-induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections. these findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post-lesion da pool contributing to contralateral rotation.;0;0;1;0

"pulmonary edema and shock after high-dose aracytine-c for lymphoma; possible role of tnf-alpha and paf.";four out of 23 consecutive patients treated with high-dose ara-c for lymphomas in our institution developed a strikingly similar syndrome during the perfusion. it was characterized by the onset of fever, diarrhea, shock, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, weight gain and leukocytosis. thorough bacteriological screening failed to provide evidence of infection. sequential biological assays of il-1, il-2, tnf and paf were performed during ara-c infusion to ten patients, including the four who developed the syndrome. tnf and paf activity was found in the serum of respectively two and four of the cases, but not in the six controls. as tnf and paf are thought to be involved in the development of septic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome, we hypothesize that high-dose ara-c may be associated with cytokine release.;0;1;0;1

oxidative stress on cardiotoxicity after treatment with single and multiple doses of doxorubicin.;the mechanism of doxorubicin (dox)-induced cardiotoxicity remains controversial. wistar rats (n = 66) received dox injections intraperitoneally and were randomly assigned to 2 experimental protocols: (1) rats were killed before (-24 h, n = 8) and 24 h after (+24 h, n = 8) a single dose of dox (4 mg/kg body weight) to determine the dox acute effect and (2) rats (n = 58) received 4 injections of dox (4 mg/kg body weight/week) and were killed before the first injection (m0) and 1 week after each injection (m1, m2, m3, and m4) to determine the chronological effects. animals used at m0 (n = 8) were also used at moment -24 h of acute study. cardiac total antioxidant performance (tap), dna damage, and morphology analyses were carried out at each time point. single dose of dox was associated with increased cardiac disarrangement, necrosis, and dna damage (strand breaks (sbs) and oxidized pyrimidines) and decreased tap. the chronological study showed an effect of a cumulative dose on body weight (r = -0.99, p = 0.011), necrosis (r = 1.00, p = 0.004), tap (r = 0.95, p = 0.049), and dna sbs (r = -0.95, p = 0.049). dna sbs damage was negatively associated with tap (r = -0.98, p = 0.018), and necrosis (r = -0.97, p = 0.027). our results suggest that oxidative damage is associated with acute cardiotoxicity induced by a single dose of dox only. increased resistance to the oxidative stress is plausible for the multiple dose of dox. thus, different mechanisms may be involved in acute toxicity versus chronic toxicity.;1;0;1;0
evaluation of cardiac troponin i and t levels as markers of myocardial damage in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy rats, and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings.;"background: cardiac troponins i (ctni) and t (ctnt) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial cell injury. we investigated the diagnostic value of ctni and ctnt for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin (dox)-induced cardiomyopathy, and we examined the relationship between serial ctni and ctnt with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. methods: thirty-five wistar rats were given 1.5 mg/kg dox, i.v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg/kg bw. ten rats received saline as a control group. ctni was measured with access(r) (ng/ml) and a research immunoassay (pg/ml), and compared with ctnt, ck-mb mass and ck. by using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, lv diameters and lv fractional shortening (fs) were measured in all rats before dox or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats. histology was performed in dox-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last dox dose and in all controls. results: eighteen of the dox rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9-week period. end-diastolic (ed) and end-systolic (es) lv diameters/bw significantly increased, whereas lv fs was decreased after 9 weeks in the dox group (p<0.001). these parameters remained unchanged in controls. histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given dox revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. in 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found. only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis. a significant rise in ctnt was found in dox rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05). ctnt found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg/kg dox. maximal ctni (pg/ml) and ctnt levels were significantly increased in dox rats compared with controls (p=0.006, 0.007). ctni (ng/ml), ck-mb mass and ck remained unchanged in dox rats compared with controls. all markers remained stable in controls. analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal ctnt and ed and es lv diameters/bw (r=0.81 and 0.65; p<0.0001). a significant relationship was observed between maximal ctnt and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between lv diameters/bw and histological findings. conclusions: among markers of ischemic injury after dox in rats, ctnt showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. although there was a discrepancy between the amount of ctni and ctnt after dox, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mabs to various ctni and ctnt forms, it is likely that ctnt in rats after dox indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that ctnt should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.";1;0;1;0

brca1 r841w: a strong candidate for a common mutation with moderate phenotype.;brca1 mutations cause increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer , frequently of early onset . many different mutations occur in brca1 , including several examples of recurrent mutations , each of which accounts for a significant number of families with heritable cancer predisposition . these common mutations have an etiological role in many breast and ovarian cancer cases and provide the opportunity to examine genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-environment interactions in individuals with the identical brca1 lesion . we report a novel missense change in brca1 , 2640 c-- > t ( r841w ) , found in 3 cases from a subject group of 305 breast and 79 ovarian cancer cases from orange county , ca . these are consecutive , population-based cases not selected for age or family history . in all three cases , there is a strong family history of breast , ovarian , or other cancers possibly related to a brca1 defect and family members showed a high concordance of cancer incidence with the presence of r841w . the age of cancer onset was not always distinct from typical sporadic cases . testing of a sample of 413 unrelated individuals to examine the hypothesis that r841w might be a rare polymorphism detected one additional instance in a woman with breast cancer diagnosed at age 77 years , and cancer in one parent . r841w is likely to be an etiologically significant lesion with involvement in close to 1 % ( 95 % confidence interval of 0-1 . 7 % ) of all breast and ovarian cancers in this population .;0;0;0;1

the dcc protein and prognosis in colorectal cancer.;background  allelic loss of chromosome 18q predicts a poor outcome in patients with stage ii colorectal cancer . although the specific gene inactivated by this allelic loss has not been elucidated , the dcc ( deleted in colorectal cancer ) gene is a candidate . we investigated whether the expression of the dcc protein in tumor cells is a prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma . methods  the expression of dcc was evaluated immunohistochemically in 132 paraffin-embedded samples from patients with curatively resected stage ii and iii colorectal carcinomas . the cox proportional-hazards model was used to adjust for covariates including age , sex , tumor site , degree of tumor differentiation , and use of adjuvant therapy . results  the expression of dcc was a strong positive predictive factor for survival in both stage ii and stage iii colorectal carcinomas . in patients with stage ii disease whose tumors expressed dcc , the five-year survival rate was 94 . 3 percent , whereas in patients with dcc-negative tumors , the survival rate was 61 . 6 percent ( p stage iii disease , the respective survival rates were 59 . 3 percent and 33 . 2 percent ( p = 0 . 03 ) . conclusions  dcc is a prognostic marker in patients with stage ii or stage iii colorectal cancer . in stage ii colorectal carcinomas , the absence of dcc identifies a subgroup of patients with lesions that behave like stage iii cancers . these findings may thus have therapeutic implications in this group of patients;0;0;0;1
valvular heart disease in patients with parkinson's disease treated with pergolide. course following treatment modifications.;"valvular heart abnormalities have been reported in patients with parkinson's disease (pd) treated with pergolide. however, the incidence and severity of these abnormalities vary from study to study and their course after drug withdrawal has not been systematically assessed. objectives: to estimate the frequency and severity of valvular heart abnormality and its possible reversibility after drug withdrawal in a case-control study. methods: all pd patients in the amiens area treated with pergolide were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography. thirty pd patients participated in the study. a second echocardiography was performed (median interval: 13 months) after pergolide withdrawal (n=10 patients). controls were age- and sex-matched non-pd patients referred to the cardiology department. results: compared to controls, aortic regurgitation (or: 3.1; 95% ic: 1.1-8.8) and mitral regurgitation (or: 10.7; 95% ic: 2.1-53) were more frequent in pd patients (tricuspid: ns). the number of affected valves (n=2.4+/-0.7) and the sum of regurgitation grades (n=2.8+/-1.09) were higher (p=0.008 and p=0.006, respectively) in the pergolide group. severity of regurgitation was not correlated with pergolide cumulative dose. a restrictive pattern of valvular regurgitation, suggestive of the role of pergolide, was observed in 12/30 (40%) patients including two with heart failure. pergolide was discontinued in 10 patients with valvular heart disease, resulting in a lower regurgitation grade (p=0.01) at the second transthoracic echocardiography and the two patients with heart failure returned to nearly normal clinical examination. this study supports the high frequency of restrictive valve regurgitation in pd patients treated with pergolide and reveals that a significant improvement is usual when the treatment is converted to non-ergot dopamine agonists.";1;0;1;0

treatment of ifosfamide-induced urothelial toxicity by oral administration of sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (mesna) to patients with inoperable lung cancer.;the protective effect of oral administration of the thiol compound sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (mesna) against urothelial toxicity induced by ifosfamide (if) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable lung cancer under treatment with if (2250 mg/m2 on days 2-5) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4-week cycle. mesna was given orally on the days of treatment with if in 3 doses of 840 mg/m2, each administered at 0 hr (= injection of if), 4 hr and 8 hr p.i. out of a total of 88 courses of this treatment we observed 10 episodes of asymptomatic microscopic haematuria and no episodes of gross haematuria. in this group of 45 patients under protection with mesna there were 5 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions (total 31%). a further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with if were treated by conventional prophylactic measures (raised fluid intake and forced diuresis). in this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions (total 24%), but nearly all patients developed either gross haematuria and/or symptoms of bladder irritation (cystitis and pollakisuria). there were no appreciable differences between the mesna series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic toxicity of the cytostatic treatment. our results support the view that mesna, given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include if, simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium. protection with oral mesna is particularly suitable for outpatients.;0;0;1;1
levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with parkinson's disease: filling the bench-to-bedside gap.;levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of parkinson's disease. however, the long-term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias. although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa-induced dyskinesias, their pathogenesis is still unclear. in recent years, evidence from animal models of parkinson's disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post-receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of dyskinetic movements. recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms, dopamine receptor subtypes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias.;0;0;1;0

a genetic etiology for digeorge syndrome: consistent deletions and microdeletions of 22q11.;digeorge syndrome ( dgs ) , a developmental field defect of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches , is characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid glands and by conotruncal cardiac malformations . cytogenetic studies support the presence of a dgs critical region in band 22q11 . in the present study , we report the results of clinical , cytogenetic , and molecular studies of 14 patients with dgs . chromosome analysis , utilizing high-resolution banding techniques , detected interstitial deletions in five probands and was inconclusive for a deletion in three probands . the remaining six patients had normal karyotypes . in contrast , molecular analysis detected dna deletions in all 14 probands . two of 10 loci tested , d22s75 and d22s259 , are deleted in all 14 patients . a third locus , d22s66 , is deleted in the eight dgs probands tested . physical mapping using somatic cell hybrids places d22s66 between d22s75 and d22s259 , suggesting that it should be deleted in the remaining six cases . parent-of-origin studies were performed in five families . four probands failed to inherit a maternal allele , and one failed to inherit a paternal allele . on the basis of these families , and of six maternally and five paternally derived unbalanced-translocation dgs probands in the literature , parent of origin or imprinting does not appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of dgs . deletion of the same three loci in all 14 dgs probands begins to delineate the region of chromosome 22 critical for dgs and confirms the hypothesis that submicroscopic deletions of 22q11 are etiologic in the vast majority of cases . .;0;0;1;0
cefotetan-induced immune hemolytic anemia.;immune hemolytic anemia due to a drug-adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. we describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous cefotetan. cefotetan-dependent antibodies were detected in the patient's serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells. the eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of cefotetan, suggesting the concomitant formation of warm-reactive autoantibodies. these observations, in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular hemolysis, are consistent with drug-induced hemolytic anemia, possibly involving both drug-adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms. this case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all cephalosporins.;0;0;1;0

antagonism between interleukin 3 and erythropoietin in mice with azidothymidine-induced anemia and in bone marrow endothelial cells.;azidothymidine (azt)-induced anemia in mice can be reversed by the administration of igf-il-3 (fusion protein of insulin-like growth factor ii (igf ii) and interleukin 3). although interleukin 3 (il-3) and erythropoietin (epo) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro, injection of igf-il-3 and epo in azt-treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma epo levels as compared to animals treated with igf-il-3 or epo alone. we tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of il-3 and epo on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells. bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with epo and igf-il-3. there was a significant reduction of thymidine incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre-treated with igf-il-3 and epo. endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with epo and il-3 significantly reduced thymidine incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with epo alone. these results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with epo and il-3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production.;0;1;0;0
risk for valvular heart disease among users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before use of medication.;background: because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine had valvular disease, these drugs were withdrawn from the market. objective: to determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications. design: cohort study. setting: academic primary care practices. patients: 46 patients who used fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy. measurements: follow-up echocardiography. the primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy, defined as progression of either aortic or mitral regurgitation by at least one degree of severity and disease that met u.s. food and drug administration criteria (at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation). results: two patients (4.3% [95% ci, 0.6% to 14.8%]) receiving fenfluramine-phentermine developed valvular heart disease. one had baseline bicuspid aortic valve and mild aortic regurgitation that progressed to moderate regurgitation. the second patient developed new moderate aortic insufficiency. conclusion: users of diet medications are at risk for valvular heart disease. however, the incidence may be lower than that reported previously.;1;0;1;0
chronic lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla in spontaneously hypertensive rats.;we studied the effects of chronic selective neuronal lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and neurogenic tone in conscious, unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats. the lesions were placed via bilateral microinjections of 30 nmol/200 nl n-methyl-d-aspartic acid. the restimulation of this area with n-methyl-d-aspartic acid 15 days postlesion failed to produce a pressor response. one day postlesion, the resting mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased in lesioned rats when compared with sham rats (100 +/- 7 versus 173 +/- 4 mm hg, p less than 0.05). fifteen days later, the lesioned group still showed values significantly lower than the sham group (150 +/- 6 versus 167 +/- 5 mm hg, p less than 0.05). no significant heart rate differences were observed between the sham and lesioned groups. the ganglionic blocker trimethaphan (5 mg/kg i.v.) caused similar reductions in mean arterial pressure in both lesioned and sham groups. the trimethaphan-induced hypotension was accompanied by a significant bradycardia in lesioned rats (-32 +/- 13 beats per minute) but a tachycardia in sham rats (+33 +/- 12 beats per minute) 1 day postlesion. therefore, rostral ventrolateral medulla neurons appear to play a significant role in maintaining hypertension in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. spinal or suprabulbar structures could be responsible for the gradual recovery of the hypertension in the lesioned rats.;1;0;1;0

effect of intravenous nimodipine on blood pressure and outcome after acute stroke.;background and purpose: the intravenous nimodipine west european stroke trial (inwest) found a correlation between nimodipine-induced reduction in blood pressure (bp) and an unfavorable outcome in acute stroke. we sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of bp reduction. methods: patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) nimodipine (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) nimodipine (n=94). the correlation between average bp change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. results: two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic bp (sbp) and diastolic bp (dbp) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. in multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between dbp reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, p=0. 048). patients with a dbp reduction of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted or for the compound outcome variable death or dependency (barthel index <60) (n/n=25/26, or 10. 16, 95% ci 1.02 to 101.74) and death alone (n/n=9/26, or 4.336, 95% ci 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n/n=62/92 and 14/92, respectively). there was no correlation between sbp change and outcome. conclusions: dbp, but not sbp, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose nimodipine after acute stroke. for low-dose nimodipine, the results were not conclusive. these results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine.;1;0;1;0

kf17837: a novel selective adenosine a2a receptor antagonist with anticataleptic activity.;"kf17837 is a novel selective adenosine a2a receptor antagonist. oral administration of kf17837 (2.5, 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the cataleptic responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an adenosine a2a receptor agonist, cgs 21680 (10 micrograms), in a dose-dependent manner. kf17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.) and by reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.). these anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0.625 and 2.5 mg/kg p.o., respectively. moreover, kf17837 (0.625 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa; 25 mg/kg i.p.) plus benserazide (6.25 mg/kg i.p.). these results suggested that kf17837 is a centrally active adenosine a2a receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by adenosine a2a receptor antagonists. furthermore, kf17837 may be a useful drug in the treatment of parkinsonism.";0;0;1;0

on two paradoxical side-effects of prednisolone in rats, ribosomal rna biosyntheses, and a mechanism of action.;liver enlargement and muscle wastage occurred in wistar rats following the subcutaneous administration of prednisolone. in the liver both the content of rna and the biosynthesis of ribosomal rna increased while both the rna content and ribosomal rna biosynthesis were reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle. it is suggested that the drug acted in a selective and tissue-specific manner to enhance ribosomal rna synthesis in the liver and depress such synthesis in the muscle. this view supports the contention that the liver and muscle are independent sites of prednisolone action.;0;1;0;0

indomethacin induced hypotension in sodium and volume depleted rats.;after a single oral dose of 4 mg/kg indomethacin (idm) to sodium and volume depleted rats plasma renin activity (pra) and systolic blood pressure fell significantly within four hours. in sodium repleted animals indomethacin did not change systolic blood pressure (bp) although plasma renin activity was decreased. thus, indomethacin by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may diminish the blood pressure maintaining effect of the stimulated renin-angiotensin system in sodium and volume depletion.;1;0;0;0

perhexiline maleate and peripheral neuropathy.;peripheral neuropathy has been noted as a complication of therapy with perhexiline maleate, a drug widely used in france (and in clinical trials in the united states) for the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris. in 24 patients with this complication, the marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity and the electromyographic changes imply mainly a demyelinating disorder. improvement was noted with cessation of therapy. in a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis, with only slight improvement. the underlying mechanism causing the neuropathy is not yet fully known, although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process.;0;0;1;0
safety and compliance with once-daily niacin extended-release/lovastatin as initial therapy in the impact of medical subspecialty on patient compliance to treatment (impact) study.;niacin extended-release/lovastatin is a new combination product approved for treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. this open-labeled, multicenter study evaluated the safety of bedtime niacin extended-release/lovastatin when dosed as initial therapy and patient compliance to treatment in various clinical practice settings. a total of 4,499 patients with dyslipidemia requiring drug intervention was enrolled at 1,081 sites. patients were treated with 1 tablet (500 mg of niacin extended-release/20 mg of lovastatin) once nightly for 4 weeks and then 2 tablets for 8 weeks. patients also received dietary counseling, educational materials, and reminders to call a toll-free number that provided further education about dyslipidemia and niacin extended-release/lovastatin. primary end points were study compliance, increases in liver transaminases to >3 times the upper limit of normal, and clinical myopathy. final study status was available for 4,217 patients (94%). compliance to niacin extended-release/lovastatin was 77%, with 3,245 patients completing the study. patients in the southeast and those enrolled by endocrinologists had the lowest compliance and highest adverse event rates. flushing was the most common adverse event, reported by 18% of patients and leading to discontinuation by 6%. incidence of increased aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase >3 times the upper limit of normal was <0.3%. an increase of creatine phosphokinase to >5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.24% of patients, and no cases of drug-induced myopathy were observed. niacin extended-release/lovastatin 1,000/40 mg, dosed as initial therapy, was associated with good compliance and safety and had very low incidences of increased liver and muscle enzymes.;0;1;0;0

intracranial aneurysms and cocaine abuse: analysis of prognostic indicators.;"objective: the outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse is reportedly poor. however, no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome. methods: a review of admissions during a 6-year period revealed 14 patients with cocaine-related aneurysms. this group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with ruptured aneurysms and no history of cocaine abuse. age at presentation, time of ictus after intoxication, hunt and hess grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage, size of the aneurysm, location of the aneurysm, and the glasgow outcome scale score were assessed and compared. results: the patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group (p < 0.002). in patients in the study group, all aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation. the majority of these aneurysms were smaller than those of the control group (8 +/- 6.08 mm versus 11 +/- 5.4 mm; p = 0.05). the differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant. hunt and hess grade (p < 0.005) and age (p < 0.007) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with cocaine-related aneurysms. conclusion: cocaine use predisposed aneurysmal rupture at a significantly earlier age and in much smaller aneurysms. contrary to the published literature, this group did reasonably well with aggressive management.";0;0;1;0
additional copies of the proteolipid protein gene causing pelizaeus-merzbacher disease arise by separate integration into the x chromosome.;the proteolipid protein gene ( plp ) is normally present at chromosome xq22 . mutations and duplications of this gene are associated with pelizaeus-merzbacher disease ( pmd ) . here we describe two new families in which males affected with pmd were found to have a copy of plp on the short arm of the x chromosome , in addition to a normal copy on xq22 . in the first family , the extra copy was first detected by the presence of heterozygosity of the ahaii dimorphism within the plp gene . the results of fish analysis showed an additional copy of plp in xp22 . 1 , although no chromosomal rearrangements could be detected by standard karyotype analysis . another three affected males from the family had similar findings . in a second unrelated family with signs of pmd , cytogenetic analysis showed a pericentric inversion of the x chromosome . in the inv ( x ) carried by several affected family members , fish showed plp signals at xp11 . 4 and xq22 . a third family has previously been reported , in which affected members had an extra copy of the plp gene detected at xq26 in a chromosome with an otherwise normal banding pattern . the identification of three separate families in which plp is duplicated at a noncontiguous site suggests that such duplications could be a relatively common but previously undetected cause of genetic disorders .;0;0;1;0
diazepam facilitates reflex bradycardia in conscious rats.;the effects of diazepam on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats. intravenous administration of diazepam (1-30 mg kg-1) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. also, reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1). intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam, although causing no change in the adrenaline-induced pressor effect, did enhance the adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia. however, the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picrotoxin (an agent blocks chloride channels by binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine-gaba-chloride channel macromolecular complex). the data indicate that diazepam acts through the benzodiazepine-gaba-chloride channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex bradycardia mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure.;1;1;1;0

somatic mutations of the apc gene in colorectal tumors: mutation cluster region in the apc gene.;"we examined somatic mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) gene in 63 colorectal tumors ( 16 adenomas and 47 carcinomas ) developed in familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) and non-fap patients . in addition to loss of heterozygosity ( loh ) at the apc locus in 30 tumors , 43 other somatic mutations were detected . twenty-one of them were point mutations ; 16 nonsense and two missense mutations , and three occurred in introns at the splicing site . twenty-two tumors had frameshift mutations due to deletion or insertion ; nineteen of them were deletions of one to 31 bp and three were a 1-bp insertion . one tumor had a 1-bp deletion in an intron near the splicing site . hence , 41 ( 95 % ) of 43 mutations resulted in truncation of the apc protein . over 60 % of the somatic mutations in the apc gene were clustered within a small region of exon 15 , designated as mcr ( mutation cluster region ) , which accounted for less than 10 % of the coding region . combining these data and the results of loh , more than 80 % of tumors ( 14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas ) had at least one mutation in the apc gene , of which more than 60 % ( 9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas ) had two mutations . these results strongly suggest that somatic mutations of the apc gene are associated with development of a great majority of colorectal tumors . .";0;0;0;1

effect of methoxamine on maximum urethral pressure in women with genuine stress incontinence: a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study.;the aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role for a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence. a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design was employed. half log incremental doses of intravenous methoxamine or placebo (saline) were administered to a group of women with genuine stress incontinence while measuring maximum urethral pressure (mup), blood pressure, heart rate, and symptomatic side effects. methoxamine evoked non-significant increases in mup and diastolic blood pressure but caused a significant rise in systolic blood pressure and significant fall in heart rate at maximum dosage. systemic side effects including piloerection, headache, and cold extremities were experienced in all subjects. the results indicate that the clinical usefulness of direct, peripherally acting sub-type-selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonists in the medical treatment of stress incontinence may be limited by associated piloerection and cardiovascular side effects.;1;0;0;0

all-trans retinoic acid-induced inflammatory myositis in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia.;all-trans retinoic acid (atra), a component of standard therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (apl), is associated with potentially serious but treatable adverse effects involving numerous organ systems, including rare skeletal muscle involvement. only a handful of cases of atra-induced myositis in children have been reported, and none in the radiology literature. we present such a case in a 15-year-old boy with apl, where recognition of imaging findings played a crucial role in making the diagnosis and facilitated prompt, effective treatment.;0;0;1;1
systolic pressure variation is greater during hemorrhage than during sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension in ventilated dogs.;the systolic pressure variation (spv), which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure (sbp) after one positive-pressure breath, was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension. mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage (hem, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (snp, n = 7). during hem-induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the snp group. the systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups. analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups. the spv during hypotension was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm hg in the hem group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm hg in the snp group (p less than 0.02). the delta down, which is the measure of decrease of sbp after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm hg in the hem and snp groups, respectively, during hypotension (p less than 0.02). it is concluded that increases in the spv and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in preload. they are thus more important during absolute hypovolemia than during deliberate hypotension.;1;0;0;0
focal cerebral ischemia in rats: effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension during reperfusion.;"after 180 min of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats, the effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension on ischemic brain injury and blood-brain barrier permeability was determined. blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during 120 min of reperfusion: control, normotensive reperfusion; 90/hypertension (90/htn), blood pressure was increased by 35 mm hg during the initial 90 min of reperfusion only; 15/hypertension (15/htn), normotensive reperfusion for 30 min followed by 15 min of hypertension and 75 min of normotension. part a, for eight rats in each group brain injury was evaluated by staining tissue using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and edema was evaluated by microgravimetry. part b, for eight different rats in each group blood-brain barrier permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount and extent of extravasation of evans blue dye. brain injury (percentage of the ischemic hemisphere) was less in the 15/htn group (16 +/- 6, mean +/- sd) versus the 90/htn group (30 +/- 6), which was in turn less than the control group (42 +/- 5). specific gravity was greater in the 15/htn group (1.043 +/- 0.002) versus the 90/htn (1.036 +/- 0.003) and control (1.037 +/- 0.003) groups. evans blue (mug g-1 of brain tissue) was greater in the 90/htn group (24.4 +/- 6.0) versus the control group (12.3 +/- 4.1), which was in turn greater than the 15/htn group (7.3 +/- 3.2). this study supports a hypothesis that during reperfusion, a short interval of hypertension decreases brain injury and edema; and that sustained hypertension increases the risk of vasogenic edema.";1;0;1;0
a novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the bbb.;the purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (bbb) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. a tween 80-coated poly-l-lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the bbb. tacrine, administered in licl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage. the toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-l-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in licl-pre-treated wistar rats. all the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of cns adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). in addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in ca1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals. empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals. in conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the bbb in vivo.;0;1;1;0

renal fanconi syndrome and myopathy after liver transplantation: drug-related mitochondrial cytopathy?;advances in the field of transplantation provide a better quality of life and allow more favorable conditions for growth and development in children. however, combinations of different therapeutic regimens require consideration of potential adverse reactions. we describe a 15-yr-old girl who had orthotopic liver transplantation because of wilson's disease. tacrolimus, mmf, and steroids were given as immunosuppressant. lamivudine was added because of de nova hepatitis b infection during her follow-up. three yr after transplantation she developed renal fanconi syndrome with severe metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria. although tacrolimus was suspected to be the cause of late post-transplant renal acidosis and was replaced by sirolimus, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance got worse. proximal muscle weakness has developed during her follow-up. fanconi syndrome, as well as myopathy, is well recognized in patients with mitochondrial disorders and caused by depletion of mtdna. we suggest that our patient's tubular dysfunction and myopathy may have resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction which is triggered by tacrolimus and augmented by lamivudine.;0;1;0;0
cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects of temsirolimus in refractory mantle cell lymphoma.;mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) is a rare and aggressive type of b-cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma. patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and their prognosis is poor. however, a 38% remission rate has been recently reported in refractory mcl treated with temsirolimus, a mtor inhibitor.here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory mcl who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment, and a progression-free survival of 10 months. in this case, lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy. comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells. apart from this cytostatic effect, temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of vegf expression. moreover, numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post-necrotic tissue repair, were found after 6-month temsirolimus therapy. thus, temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects.this dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory mcl resistant to conventional chemotherapy.;0;0;1;1
decreased expression of na/k-atpase, nhe3, nbc1, aqp1 and oat in gentamicin-induced nephropathy.;the present study was aimed to determine whether there is an altered regulation of tubular transporters in gentamicin-induced nephropathy. sprague-dawley male rats (200~250 g) were subcutaneously injected with gentamicin (100 mg/kg per day) for 7 days, and the expression of tubular transporters was determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. the mrna and protein expression of oat was also determined. gentamicin-treated rats exhibited significantly decreased creatinine clearance along with increased plasma creatinine levels. accordingly, the fractional excretion of sodium increased. urine volume was increased, while urine osmolality and free water reabsorption were decreased. immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased expression of na(+)/k(+)-atpase, nhe3, nbc1, and aqp1 in the kidney of gentamicin-treated rats. the expression of oat1 and oat3 was also decreased. gentamicin-induced nephropathy may at least in part be causally related with a decreased expression of na(+)/k(+)-atpase, nhe3, nbc1, aqp1 and oat.;0;1;0;0

transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of the high mobility group i-c protein develop adiposity and an abnormally high prevalence of lipomas.;chromosomal translocations in human lipomas frequently create fusion transcripts encoding high mobility group ( hmg ) i-c dna-binding domains and c-terminal sequences from different presumed transcription factors , suggesting a potential role for hmg i-c in the development of lipomas . to evaluate the role of the hmg i-c component , the three dna-binding domains of hmg i-c have now been expressed in transgenic mice . despite the ubiquitous expression of the truncated hmg i-c protein , the transgenic mice develop a selective abundance of fat tissue early in life , show marked adipose tissue inflammation , and have an abnormally high incidence of lipomas . these findings demonstrate that the dna-binding domains of hmg i-c , in the absence of a c-terminal fusion partner , are sufficient to perturb adipogenesis and predispose to lipomas . we provide data supporting the central utility of this animal model as a tool to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of one of the most common kind of human benign tumors . .;0;0;0;1
evidence of functional somatotopy in gpi from results of pallidotomy.;the objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus (gpi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian 'off' signs and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (lid). we found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests (core assessment program for intracerebral transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in lid. we also found a highly significant correlation (p: < 0.0001, r = 0.8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the gpi and the improvement in lid in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian 'off' signs. the volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian 'off' signs. the differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian 'off' signs and lid and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian 'off' signs and dyskinesias. whereas cells in a wider area of the gpi may be implicated in parkinsonism, the ventral gpi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of lid. we suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the gpi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy. the outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal gpi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms, and hence could be variable.;0;0;1;0
genetic basis and molecular mechanism for idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.;ventricular fibrillation causes more than 300 , 000 sudden deaths each year in the usa alone . in approximately 5-12 % of these cases , there are no demonstrable cardiac or non-cardiac causes to account for the episode , which is therefore classified as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation ( ivf ) . a distinct group of ivf patients has been found to present with a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern . because of the small size of most pedigrees and the high incidence of sudden death , however , molecular genetic studies of ivf have not yet been done . because ivf causes cardiac rhythm disturbance , we investigated whether malfunction of ion channels could cause the disorder by studying mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene scn5a . we have now identified a missense mutation , a splice-donor mutation , and a frameshift mutation in the coding region of scn5a in three ivf families . we show that sodium channels with the missense mutation recover from inactivation more rapidly than normal and that the frameshift mutation causes the sodium channel to be non-functional . our results indicate that mutations in cardiac ion-channel genes contribute to the risk of developing ivf . .;1;0;0;0

magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in epileptic patients after phenytoin overdosages.;the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phenytoin medication and cerebellar atrophy in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication. five females and 6 males, 21-59 years of age, were examined with a 1.5-t whole-body system using a circular polarized head coil. conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation. in addition, we performed a high-resolution 3d gradient echo, t1-weighted sequences at a 1-mm slice thickness. the images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum. cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67.66 and 131.08 ml (mean 108.9 ml). in addition 3d gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age-matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes. using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration, elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume. however, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters. we conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients. quantitative morphometric studies of the cerebellum provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cerebellar disorders.;0;0;1;0
cocaine-induced myocardial infarction: clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations.;clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute myocardial infarction. in individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine-induced increase in rate-pressure product. in other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction, coronary occlusion may be due to spasm, thrombus, or both. with regard to spasm, the clinical findings are largely circumstantial, and the locus of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction remains speculative. although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial, medium-size vessels, other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction. diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental, discrete infarction. whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha-mediated, other in vitro data suggest the opposite. the finding of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction in segments of (noninnervated) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha-mediated effects. finally, the contribution of a primary, thrombotic effect of cocaine has not been excluded.;1;0;1;0

frequency of exon 15 missense mutation (442d:g) in cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene in hyperalphalipoproteinemic japanese subjects.;"cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( cetp ) transfers cholesteryl ester from high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) to apo b-containing lipoproteins . the hyperalphalipoproteinemia caused by cetp deficiency is fairly common in japan and one of the most common mutations in the cetp gene is the splicing defect of the intron 14 , the allelic frequency of which has been shown to be 0 . 0049 in the japanese general population . recently , we have reported a missense mutation in exon 15 of the cetp gene ( 442d  g ) , showing a dominant effect on the cetp activity and hdl-cholesterol level . in the current study , we determined the frequency of this new mutation in japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic ( hdl-cholesterol > or = 100 mg / dl ) subjects . a rapid and easy screening method for this new mutation was developed using a polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) -mediated site-directed mutagenesis . among 117 japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects ( hdl-cholesterol ; 116 . 7 + / - 16 . 5 mg / dl , mean + / - s . d . ) without the intron 14 splice defect , three homozygotes ( 2 . 5 % ) and 34 heterozygotes ( 29 . 1 % ) were found to have the 442d  g mutation . the relative allelic frequency of this mutation was calculated to be 0 . 17 . one of the homozygotes for the 442d  g mutation was the patient previously described by us as having hyperalphalipoproteinemia with corneal opacity and coronary heart disease . this was the first reported subject homozygous for the cetp deficiency who also demonstrated atherosclerotic symptoms . in homozygous subjects , cetp activity ranged from 37 % to 62 % of the normal value , which was consistent with the results obtained from the transient expression experiment previously reported ; however , the specific activity of cetp was not as low as expected .

linkage analysis of the apolipoprotein c2 gene and myotonic dystrophy on human chromosome 19 reveals linkage disequilibrium in a french-canadian population.;the gene for human apolipoprotein c2 ( apoc2 ) , situated on the proximal long arm of chromosome 19 , is closely linked to the gene for the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy , myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) . six apoc2 rflps ( taqi , bgli , bani , bamhi , ncoi , and avaii ) have been identified to date . we have conducted a comprehensive dm linkage study utilizing all six rflps and involving 50 families and 372 individuals . the most informative rflps are , in descending order , ncoi ( lod = 6 . 64 , theta = 0 . 05 ) , bgli ( lod = 6 . 12 , theta = 0 . 05 ) , avaii ( lod = 6 . 02 , theta = 0 . 03 ) , bani ( lod = 5 . 76 , theta = 0 . 04 ) , taqi ( lod = 4 . 29 , theta = 0 . 06 ) , and bamhi ( lod = 1 . 75 , theta = 0 . 01 ) . a substantial increase in the lod scores over those seen with the individual rflps was obtained when the linkage of the entire apoc2 haplotype ( composed of the six rflps ) was studied ( lod = 17 . 87 , theta = 0 . 04 ) . we have observed significant inter-apoc2 rflp linkage disequilibrium . consequently , the three most informative rflps have been found to be bani , taqi , and either bgli , avaii , or ncoi polymorphisms . we also demonstrate linkage disequilibrium between dm and apoc2 in our french-canadian population ( standardized disequilibrium constant phi = . 22 , chi 2 = 5 . 12 , df = 1 , p less than 0 . 04 ) . this represents the first evidence of linkage disequilibrium between apoc2 and the dm locus .;0;0;1;0

changes in heart size during long-term timolol treatment after myocardial infarction.;the effect of long-term timolol treatment on heart size after myocardial infarction was evaluated by x-ray in a double-blind study including 241 patients (placebo 126, timolol 115). the follow-up period was 12 months. the timolol-treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group. these differences may be caused by timolol-induced bradycardia and a compensatory increase in end-diastolic volume. the timolol-related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size. in patients with cardiomegaly, the increase in heart size was similar in both groups. after re-infarction, heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the timolol group.;1;0;0;0
biphasic response of the sa node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of ketamine.;effect of ketamine on the sa node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the sa node artery. injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the sa nodal activity by a direct action. this depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase. bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine-induced tachycardia, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the sa node artery. this may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the sa node artery.;1;0;0;0

temocapril, a long-acting non-sh group angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, modulates glomerular injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis.;the purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic administration of temocapril, a long-acting non-sh group angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor, reduced proteinuria, inhibited glomerular hypertrophy and prevented glomerulosclerosis in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (pan) - induced nephrotic rats. nephrosis was induced by injection of pan (15mg/100g body weight) in male sprague-dawley (sd) rats. four groups were used, i) the pan group (14), ii) pan/temocapril (13), iii) temocapril (14) and iv) untreated controls (15). temocapril (8 mg/kg/day) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4, 14 or 20. at each time point, systolic blood pressure (bp), urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated, and morphometric image analysis was done. systolic bp in the pan group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks, but was normal in the pan/temocapril group. urinary protein excretion in the pan group increased significantly, peaking at 8 days, then decreased at 4 weeks, but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks. temocapril did not attenuate proteinuria at 8 days, but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20. the glomerulosclerosis index (gsi) was 6.21 % at 4 weeks and respectively 25.35 % and 30.49 % at 14 and 20 weeks in the pan group. there was a significant correlation between urinary protein excretion and gsi (r = 0.808, p < 0.0001). the ratio of glomerular tuft area to the area of bowman's capsules (gt/bc) in the pan group was significantly increased, but it was significantly lower in the pan/temocapril group. it appears that temocapril was effective in retarding renal progression and protected renal function in pan neprotic rats.;1;1;0;0

late cardiotoxicity after treatment for a malignant bone tumor.;cardiac function was assessed in long-term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to rosen's t5 or t10 protocol, both including doxorubicin. thirty-one patients, age 10-45 years (median age 17.8 years) were evaluated 2.3-14.1 years (median 8.9 years) following completion of treatment. cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225-550 mg/m2 (median dose 360). the evaluation consisted of a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ecg), signal averaged ecg, 24-hour ambulatory ecg, echocardiography and radionuclide angiography. eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed cardiac toxicity, defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities: late potentials, complex ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular dilation, decreased shortening fraction, or decreased ejection fraction. the incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow-up (p< or = .05). no correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status, except for heart rate variability. when adjusted to body surface area, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (lvpw index) was decreased in all patients. the incidence of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow-up, irrespective of cumulative dose. life-long cardiac follow-up in these patients is warranted. the results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and lvpw index could be sensitive indicators for cardiotoxicity.;1;0;0;1

comparison of aqueous and gellan ophthalmic timolol with placebo on the 24-hour heart rate response in patients on treatment for glaucoma.;"purpose: topical beta-blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with glaucoma. therapy results in systemic absorption, however, the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified. design: this trial evaluated the effect of placebo, 0.5% aqueous timolol (timolol solution) and a 0.5% timolol suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva (timolol gellan) on the 24-hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for glaucoma to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate. methods: forty-three caucasian patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a mean (+/-sd) age of 63 (+/-8) years were randomized and crossed over in a double-masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo (morning and evening in both eyes), timolol solution (morning and evening in both eyes), or timolol gellan (morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening). on the 13th day of each period, heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical, ambulant 24-hour period. results: both timolol solution and timolol gellan reduced the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo (p < or = .001), and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime (-7.5% change in mean heart rate, -5.7 beats/min). timolol gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24-hour heart rate, compared with timolol solution. during the night, the mean 12-hour heart rate on placebo and timolol gellan were both significantly less than on timolol solution; the difference between solution and gellan treatments was statistically significant (p = .01). conclusions: both timolol solution and timolol gellan decrease the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo. this response was most pronounced during the active daytime period. these data quantify the modest bradycardia associated with ophthalmic beta-blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for glaucoma. although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial, reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences.";1;0;1;0

effect of lindane on hepatic and brain cytochrome p450s and influence of p450 modulation in lindane induced neurotoxicity.;oral administration of lindane (2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, body weight) for 5 days was found to produce a dose-dependent increase in the activity of p450 dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (erod), 7-pentoxyresorufin-o-dealkylase (prod) and n-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (ndma-d) in rat brain and liver. a significant increase in the hepatic and brain p450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose (2.5 mg/kg) of lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days. as observed with different doses, the magnitude of induction in the activity of p450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain. western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the p450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of p450 1a1/1a2, 2b1/2b2 and 2e1 isoenzymes. in vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual p450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of prod, erod and ndma-d are due to the increase in the levels of p450 2b1/2b2, 1a1/1a2 and 2e1 isoenzymes, respectively. induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3-methylcholanthrene (mc), an inducer of p4501a1/1a2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of lindane induced convulsions, pretreatment with phenobarbital (pb), an inducer of p450 2b1/2b2 or ethanol, an inducer of p450 2e1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions. similarly, when the p450-mediated metabolism of lindane was blocked by cobalt chloride incidence of convulsions was increased in animals treated with lindane indicating that lindane per se or its metabolites formed by pb or ethanol inducible p450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral toxicity.;0;1;1;0

effects of the intracoronary infusion of cocaine on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in humans.;background: in dogs, a large amount of intravenous cocaine causes a profound deterioration of left ventricular (lv) systolic function and an increase in lv end-diastolic pressure. this study was done to assess the influence of a high intracoronary cocaine concentration on lv systolic and diastolic function in humans. methods and results: in 20 patients (14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of chest pain, we measured heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, lv pressure and its first derivative (dp/dt), and lv volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion of saline (n=10, control subjects) or cocaine hydrochloride 1 mg/min (n=10). no variable changed with saline. with cocaine, the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3.0+/-0.4 (mean+/-sd) mg/l, similar in magnitude to the blood cocaine concentration reported in abusers dying of cocaine intoxication. cocaine induced no significant change in heart rate, lv dp/dt (positive or negative), or lv end-diastolic volume, but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures, lv end-diastolic pressure, and lv end-systolic volume, as well as a decrease in lv ejection fraction. conclusions: in humans, the intracoronary infusion of cocaine sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a deterioration of lv systolic and diastolic performance.;1;0;0;0

risk of nephropathy after consumption of nonionic contrast media by children undergoing cardiac angiography: a prospective study.;despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast media-induced nephropathy (cin) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures, the studies in pediatrics are limited, with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography. this prospective study determined the incidence of cin for two nonionic contrast media (cm), iopromide and iohexol, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of cm and the presence of cyanosis. the 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide (group a, n = 40) or iohexol (group b, n = 40). serum sodium (na), potassium (k), and creatinine (cr) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values, then measured again at 12-, 24-, and 48-h intervals after cm use. urine samples for na and cr also were checked at the same intervals. risk of renal failure, injury to the kidney, failure of kidney function, loss of kidney function, and end-stage renal damage (rifle criteria) were used to define cin and its incidence in the study population. accordingly, among the 15 cin patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group a had increased risk and 3.75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group b had increased risk and 2.5% had renal injury. whereas 33.3% of the patients with cin were among those who received the proper dosage of cm, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of cin related to the different dosages of cm (p = 0.014). among the 15 patients with cin, 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243). although clinically silent, cin is not rare in pediatrics. the incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic cm, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although cin usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.;1;1;0;0
electrocardiographic changes and cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving psychotropic drugs.;"eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life-threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs, either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants. although most patients were receiving several drugs, mellaril (thioridazine) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving thorazine (chlorpromazine). aventyl (nortriptyline) and elavil (amitriptyline) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman. electrocardiographic t and u wave abnormalities were present in most patients. the ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one. the tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped. five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease. major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs. a prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs.";1;0;0;0

spironolactone: is it a novel drug for the prevention of amphotericin b-related hypokalemia in cancer patients?;objective: nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin b (amb), often limiting administration of full dosage. selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with amb. potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of amb. this study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on amb treatment. methods: in this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous amb alone or amb and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection. results: patients receiving concomitant amb and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving amb alone (p = 0.0027). those patients receiving amb and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range (p = 0.022). moreover, urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving amb and spironolactone than those receiving amb alone (p = 0.040). conclusion: this study showed that spironolactone can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on amb treatment.;0;1;1;1
effect of aspirin on n-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide-induced epithelial proliferation in the urinary bladder and forestomach of the rat.;the co-administration of aspirin with n-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide (fanft) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of fanft-induced bladder carcinomas but a concomitant induction of forestomach tumors. an autoradiographic study was performed on male f-344 rats fed diet containing fanft at a level of 0.2% and/or aspirin at a level of 0.5% to evaluate the effect of aspirin on the increased cell proliferation induced by fanft in the forestomach and bladder. fanft-induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by aspirin co-administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks. in the forestomach, and also in the liver, aspirin did not affect the fanft-induced increase in labeling index. the present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in fanft carcinogenesis in the bladder and forestomach, and that aspirin's effect on fanft in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation. also, there appears to be an adaptation by the rats to the chronic ingestion of aspirin.;0;1;1;1
ifosfamide encephalopathy presenting with asterixis.;cns toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent ifosfamide (ifx) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use. we report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative myoclonus of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of ifosfamide for plasmacytoma. he was awake, revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms. cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal structural lesions of the brain and metabolic abnormalities. an electroencephalogram showed continuous, generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic encephalopathy. the administration of ifosfamide was discontinued and within 12 h the asterixis resolved completely. in the patient described, the presence of asterixis during infusion of ifosfamide, normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative myoclonus is associated with the use of ifx.;0;0;1;0

thalidomide and sensory neurotoxicity: a neurophysiological study.;background: recent studies confirmed a high incidence of sensory axonal neuropathy in patients treated with different doses of thalidomide. the study's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential (sap) amplitude in patients with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus (cle) treated with thalidomide and use these findings to identify the neurotoxic potential of thalidomide and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment. patients and methods: clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with cle during treatment with thalidomide and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed. sural nerve sap amplitude reduction > or =40% was the criteria for discontinuing therapy. results: during treatment, 11 patients showed a reduction in sural nerve sap amplitude compared to baseline values (9 with a reduction > or =50% and 2 <50%). one patient showed no changes in sap amplitude. five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps. after thalidomide treatment, sural sap amplitude recovered in 3 patients. at detection of reduction in sural nerve sap amplitude, the median thalidomide cumulative dose was 21.4 g. the threshold neurotoxic dosage is lower than previously reported. conclusions: sural nerve sap amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres. this electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical neurotoxic potential of thalidomide but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms.;0;0;1;0

incidence of solid tumours among pesticide applicators exposed to the organophosphate insecticide diazinon in the agricultural health study: an updated analysis.;"objective: diazinon, a common organophosphate insecticide with genotoxic properties, was previously associated with lung cancer in the agricultural health study (ahs) cohort, but few other epidemiological studies have examined diazinon-associated cancer risk. we used updated diazinon exposure and cancer incidence information to evaluate solid tumour risk in the ahs. methods: male pesticide applicators in iowa and north carolina reported lifetime diazinon use at enrolment (1993-1997) and follow-up (1998-2005); cancer incidence was assessed through 2010(north carolina)/2011(iowa). among applicators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure-response patterns, we used poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios (rrs) and 95% ci for cancer sites with >10 exposed cases for both lifetime (lt) exposure days and intensity-weighted (iw) lifetime exposure days (accounting for factors impacting exposure). results: we observed elevated lung cancer risks (n=283) among applicators with the greatest number of lt (rr=1.60; 95% ci 1.11 to 2.31; ptrend=0.02) and iw days of diazinon use (rr=1.41; 95% ci 0.98 to 2.04; ptrend=0.08). kidney cancer (n=94) risks were non-significantly elevated (rrlt days=1.77; 95% ci 0.90 to 3.51; ptrend=0.09; rriw days 1.37; 95% ci 0.64 to 2.92; ptrend=0.50), as were risks for aggressive prostate cancer (n=656). conclusions: our updated evaluation of diazinon provides additional evidence of an association with lung cancer risk. newly identified links to kidney cancer and associations with aggressive prostate cancer require further evaluation.";0;1;0;1

a novel missense mutation in patients from a retinoblastoma pedigree showing only mild expression of the tumor phenotype.;we have used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to study the 27 exons of the rb1 gene in individuals from a family showing mild expression of the retinoblastoma phenotype . in this family affected individuals developed unilateral tumors and , as a result of linkage analysis , unaffected mutation carriers were also identified within the pedigree . a single band shift using sscp was identified in exon 21 which resulted in a missense mutation converting a cys-- > arg at nucleotide position 28 in the exon . the mutation destroyed an ndei restriction enzyme site . analysis of all family members demonstrated that the missense mutation co-segregated with patients with tumors or who , as a result of linkage analysis had been predicted to carry the predisposing mutation . these observations point to another region of the rb1 gene where mutations only modify the function of the gene and raise important questions for genetic counseling in families with these distinctive phenotypes . .;0;0;0;1

mice deficient in six5 develop cataracts: implications for myotonic dystrophy.;expansion of a ctg trinucleotide repeat in the 3 utr of the gene dmpk at the dm1 locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy , a dominantly inherited disease characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and myotonia , cataracts and cardiac conduction defects . targeted deletion of dm15 , the mouse orthologue of human dmpk , produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities , but without other features of myotonic dystrophy , such as myotonia and cataracts . we , and others , have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene six5 ( refs 7 , 8 ) , which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor . to determine whether six5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype , we disrupted mouse six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta-galactosidase reporter . six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues , including the developing lens . homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function , but developed lenticular opacities at a higher rate than controls . our results suggest that six5 deficiency contributes to the cataract phenotype in myotonic dystrophy , and that myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder . .;0;0;1;0

studies of synergy between morphine and a novel sodium channel blocker, cnsb002, in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.;"objective: this study determined the antihyperalgesic effect of cnsb002, a sodium channel blocker with antioxidant properties given alone and in combinations with morphine in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. design: dose response curves for nonsedating doses of morphine and cnsb002 given intraperitoneally alone and together in combinations were constructed for antihyperalgesic effect using paw withdrawal from noxious heat in two rat pain models: carrageenan-induced paw inflammation and streptozotocin (stz)-induced diabetic neuropathy. results: the maximum nonsedating doses were: morphine, 3.2 mg/kg; cnsb002 10.0 mg/kg; 5.0 mg/kg cnsb002 with morphine 3.2 mg/kg in combination. the doses calculated to cause 50% reversal of hyperalgesia (ed50) were 7.54 (1.81) and 4.83 (1.54) in the carrageenan model and 44.18 (1.37) and 9.14 (1.24) in the stz-induced neuropathy model for cnsb002 and morphine, respectively (mg/kg; mean, sem). these values were greater than the maximum nonsedating doses. the ed50 values for morphine when given in combination with cnsb002 (5 mg/kg) were less than the maximum nonsedating dose: 0.56 (1.55) in the carrageenan model and 1.37 (1.23) in the neuropathy model (mg/kg; mean, sem). the antinociception after morphine (3.2 mg/kg) was increased by co-administration with cnsb002 from 28.0 and 31.7% to 114.6 and 56.9% reversal of hyperalgesia in the inflammatory and neuropathic models, respectively (p < 0.01; one-way analysis of variance-significantly greater than either drug given alone). conclusions: the maximum antihyperalgesic effect achievable with nonsedating doses of morphine may be increased significantly when the drug is used in combination with cnsb002.";0;0;1;0

rates of renal toxicity in cancer patients receiving cisplatin with and without mannitol.;"background: cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic. one of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. there are many strategies to prevent this toxicity, including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration. objective: we aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single-agent cisplatin with and without mannitol. methods: this single-center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage. data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single-agent cisplatin as an outpatient from january 2011 to september 2012. the primary outcome was acute kidney injury (aki). results: we evaluated 143 patients who received single-agent cisplatin; 97.2% of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy. patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity: odds ratio [or] = 2.646 (95% ci = 1.008, 6.944; p = 0.048). patients who received the 100 mg/m(2) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity: or = 11.494 (95% ci = 4.149, 32.258; p < 0.0001) and or = 3.219 (95% ci = 1.228, 8.439; p = 0.017), respectively. conclusions: when limited quantities of mannitol are available, it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity. our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg/m(2) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol.";1;1;0;1

cardioprotective effect of tincture of crataegus on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.;tincture of crataegus (tcr), an alcoholic extract of the berries of hawthorn (crataegus oxycantha), is used in herbal and homeopathic medicine. the present study was done to investigate the protective effect of tcr on experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats. pretreatment of tcr, at a dose of 0.5 ml/100 g bodyweight per day, orally for 30 days, prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and activity of marker enzymes observed in isoproterenol-induced rats (85 mg kg(-1) s. c. for 2 days at an interval of 24 h). tcr prevented the isoproterenol-induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the rate of adp-stimulated oxygen uptake and respiratory coupling ratio. tcr protected against pathological changes induced by isoproterenol in rat heart. the results show that pretreatment with tcr may be useful in preventing the damage induced by isoproterenol in rat heart.;1;0;0;0
treatment of tacrolimus-related adverse effects by conversion to cyclosporine in liver transplant recipients.;"when tacrolimus side effects persist despite dose reduction, conversion to cyclosporine-based immunosuppression (cya) is necessary. we characterized tacrolimus side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug, and outcomes after conversion. of 388 liver recipients who received tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression, 70 required conversion to cya. we recorded indication for conversion, whether conversion was early or late after transplantation, tacrolimus dose and trough blood level at conversion, and incidence of rejection after conversion. conversion was early in 29 patients (41.4%) and late in 41 (58.6%). indications for early conversion were neurotoxicity (20), (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (iddm) (5), nephrotoxicity (3), gastrointestinal (gi) toxicity (6), and cardiomyopathy (1), and for late conversion were neurotoxicity (15), iddm (12), nephrotoxicity (3), gi toxicity (5), hepatotoxicity (6), post-transplant lmphoproliferate disease (ptld) (2), cardiomyopathy (1), hemolytic anemia (1), and pruritus (1). all early-conversion patients showed improvement/resolution of symptoms. among late-conversion patients, 37 (90.2%) had improvement/resolution; in 4 (9.8%), adverse effects persisted. the overall rejection rate was 30%. sixty-two patients (88.6%) are alive with functioning grafts 686 +/- 362 days (range, 154-1433 days) after conversion. when tacrolimus side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction, conversion to cya can be accomplished safely, with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long-term outcome.";1;1;1;0

delayed toxicity of cyclophosphamide on the bladder of dba/2 and c57bl/6 female mouse.;the present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice (dba/2) but not in a resistant strain (c57bl/6) when both were treated with a single 300 mg/kg dose of cyclophosphamide (cy). inbred dba/2 and c57bl/6 female mice were injected with cy, and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures, and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy. early cy toxicity caused a typical haemorrhagic cystitis in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7-10 days. after 30 days of cy injection ulcerous and non-ulcerous forms of chronic cystitis appeared in 86% of dba/2 mice but only in 4% of c57bl/6 mice. delayed cystitis was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium. mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in dba/2 mice than in c57bl/6 mice or untreated controls. electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells. instead, numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers. delayed cystitis still persisted in dba/2 mice 100 days after treatment. these results indicate that delayed toxicity of cy in female dba/2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in c57bl/6 mice. this pathology resembles interstitial cystitis in humans and could perhaps be used as an animal model for studies on the disease.;0;0;1;0
valproate-induced chorea and encephalopathy in atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia.;nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments. in the classical form it presents as neonatal apnea, intractable seizures, and hypotonia, followed by significant psychomotor retardation. an important subset of children with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner. this report describes a patient with mild language delay and mental retardation, who was found to have nonketotic hyperglycinemia following her presentation with acute encephalopathy and chorea shortly after initiation of valproate therapy.;0;0;1;0
blood brain barrier in right- and left-pawed female rats assessed by a new staining method.;the asymmetrical breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (bbb) was studied in female rats. paw preference was assessed by a food reaching test. adrenaline-induced hypertension was used to destroy the bbb, which was evaluated using triphenyltetrazolium (ttc) staining of the brain slices just after giving adrenaline for 30 s. in normal rats, the whole brain sections exhibited complete staining with ttc. after adrenaline infusion for 30 s, there were large unstained areas in the left brain in right-pawed animals, and vice versa in left-pawed animals. similar results were obtained in seizure-induced breakdown of bbb. these results were explained by an asymmetric cerebral blood flow depending upon the paw preference in rats. it was suggested that this new method and the results are consistent with contralateral motor control that may be important in determining the dominant cerebral hemisphere in animals.;1;1;1;0

pharmacokinetics of desipramine hcl when administered with cinacalcet hcl.;objective: in vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome p450 isoenzyme (cyp) 2d6. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on cyp2d6 activity, using desipramine as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects. methods: seventeen subjects who were genotyped as cyp2d6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet (90 mg for 7 days). blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose. results: fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms. relative to desipramine alone, mean auc and c(max) of desipramine increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with cinacalcet. the t (1/2,z) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet (21.0 versus 43.3 hs). the t (max) was similar between the regimens. fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet. conclusion: this study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cyp2d6. these data suggest that during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet, dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by cyp2d6.;0;0;1;0

methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling.;methamphetamine (meth) damages dopamine (da) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated. cardona et al. [nat. neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (cx3cr1) as an important mediator of mptp-induced neurodegeneration of da neurons. because the cns damage caused by meth and mptp is highly selective for the da neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the cx3cr1 plays a role in meth-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation. mice in which the cx3cr1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cdna encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) were treated with meth and examined for striatal neurotoxicity. meth depleted da, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in cx3cr1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls. the effects of meth in cx3cr1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum. striatal microglia expressing egfp constitutively show morphological changes after meth that are characteristic of activation. this response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive egfp-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by meth. we conclude from these studies that cx3cr1 signaling does not modulate meth neurotoxicity or microglial activation. furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to meth with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.;0;0;1;0

mechanisms underlying latent disease risk associated with early-life arsenic exposure: current research trends and scientific gaps.;background: millions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (ias) in their drinking water. inorganic as exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood. there is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early-life ias exposure to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to cancer. objectives: this work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood that is associated with early-life ias exposure. discussion: epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression, the development of cancer stem cells, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early-life ias exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects. conclusions: evidence is mounting that relates early-life ias exposure and cancer development later in life. future research should include animal studies that address mechanistic hypotheses and studies of human populations that integrate early-life exposure, molecular alterations, and latent disease outcomes.;0;0;1;1

adrenoleukodystrophy gene encodes an 80 kda membrane protein.;an antibody against the synthetic c-terminal peptides deduced from the cdna of the gene responsible for x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) was produced to characterize the product of the ald gene . the antibody reacted with the 80 kda band protein in control fibroblasts , while no bands were detected in the fibroblasts from a patient with ald ( # 163 ) , in which mrna of the ald gene was undetectable based on northern blot analysis . the 293t cells transfected with the full-coding cdna inserted in the expression vector produced a new 80 kda protein , as detected by western blot . in an immunocytological study , the staining was in a punctate pattern , in the normal fibroblasts . however , there was no punctate staining in the # 163 cells . these data thus indicate that the ald gene encodes an 80 kda membrane protein . .;0;0;1;0
adverse cardiac effects during induction chemotherapy treatment with cis-platin and 5-fluorouracil.;survival for patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma and esophageal carcinoma is poor with radiotherapy and/or surgery. obviously, there is a need for effective chemotherapy. in the present study, cis-platin (80-120 mg/m2bsa) and 5-fu (1000 mg/m2bsa daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery. the aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment. before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ecg recordings were performed. in the pre-treatment evaluation, signs of cardiovascular disease were found in 33 patients (43%). during treatment, adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients (18%). the mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group, 64 years. the incidence of cardiotoxicity was not higher in patients with signs of cardiovascular disease than in those without in the pre-treatment evaluation. the most common signs of cardiotoxicity were chest pain, st-t wave changes and atrial fibrillation. this was followed by ventricular fibrillation in one patient and sudden death in another. it is concluded that patients on 5-fu treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if chest pain or tachyarrhythmia is observed.;1;0;0;1

effect of calcium chloride and 4-aminopyridine therapy on desipramine toxicity in rats.;background: hypotension is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant overdose. recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit calcium influx in some tissues. this study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension. methods: two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker overdose. cacl2 and 4-aminopyridine. anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine ip to produce hypotension, qrs prolongation, and bradycardia. fifteen min later, animals received cacl2, nahco3, or saline. in a second experiment, rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine ip followed in 15 min by 4-aminopyridine or saline. results: nahco3 briefly (5 min) reversed hypotension and qrs prolongation. cacl2 and 4-aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure. the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (p = 0.004) and seizures (p = 0.03) in the cacl2 group was higher than the other groups. conclusion: the administration of cacl2 or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension in rats. cacl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. these findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension.;1;0;1;0
recombination events that locate myotonic dystrophy distal to apoc2 on 19q.;we previously reported a recombination in an individual with myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) which placed the markers d19s19 and apoc2 on the same side of the dm locus . haplotyping of this family with more recently characterized probes which are either tightly linked to dm or distal to the linkage group at q13 . 2 shows that the dm locus is distal to apoc2 . this is confirmed by other recombinants where dm segregates with distal probes . additional marker to marker recombinations in unaffected individuals are reported and support the order and orientation of the dm linkage group as pter- ( insr , ldlr , s9 ) - ( s19 , bcl3 , apoc2 ) - ( ckmm , dm ) - ( s22 , + + + prkcg ) -qter . the data presented here cannot determine whether dm is proximal or distal to ckmm . the consequences of this probe order for antenatal diagnosis and future research aiming to isolate the gene which is affected in dm are discussed .;0;0;1;0

prevention and treatment of endometrial disease in climacteric women receiving oestrogen therapy.;the treatment regimens are described in 74 patients with endometrial disease among 850 climacteric women receiving oestrogen therapy. cystic hyperplasia was associated with unopposed oestrogen therapy without progestagen. two courses of 21 days of 5 mg norethisterone daily caused reversion to normal in all 57 cases of cystic hyperplasia and 6 of the 8 cases of atypical hyperplasia. 4 cases of endometrial carcinoma referred from elsewhere demonstrated the problems of inappropriate and unsupervised unopposed oestrogen therapy and the difficulty in distinguishing severe hyperplasia from malignancy. cyclical low-dose oestrogen therapy with 7--13 days of progestagen does not seem to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.;0;0;1;1

recessively inherited multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with normal stature, club foot, and double layered patella caused by a dtdst mutation.;we have observed over 25 different mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulphate transporter gene ( dtdst ) in association with the recessive disorders achondrogenesis 1b , atelosteogenesis 2 , and diastrophic dysplasia . the c862t ( r279w ) transition is the most common mutation in non-finnish patients , but in these disorders it is usually combined with other dtdst mutations . we had not seen a case of homozygosity for c862t ( r279w ) until we analysed dna from a 36 year old male with tall-normal stature ( 180 cm ) who asked for genetic counselling for suspected multiple epiphyseal dysplasia . he was treated for club foot and hip dysplasia at birth . skeletal changes consistent with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia , with the peculiar finding of a double layered patella , were recognised during childhood . cleft palate , swelling of the ear pinna , and hitch hiker thumb were absent . he was found to be homozygous , and both healthy parents heterozygous , for the r279w mutation in dtdst , and his fibroblasts showed a sulphate incorporation defect typical of dtdst disorders . counselling was given for a recessive disorder , thereby considerably reducing the probability of affected offspring . multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is more frequently caused by dominant mutations in the comp ( edm1 , mckusick 132400 ) and col9a2 genes ( edm2 , mckusick 600204 ) . a few other patients and families with features similar to our proband have been described previously and considered to have autosomal recessive med ( edm4 , mckusick 226900 ) . this observation confirms the existence of this entity and assigns it to the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations at the dtdst locus . .;0;0;1;0
cerebral hemorrhage associated with phenylpropanolamine in combination with caffeine.;"phenylpropanolamine (ppa) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including stroke. it is often combined with caffeine in diet preparations and ""look-alike"" pills. in order to determine if ppa/caffeine can lead to stroke in normotensive and/or hypertensive rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days. subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage was noted in 18% of the hypertensive rats. a single ppa/caffeine administration (same dose) lead to acute hypertension in both the normotensive and hypertensive animals. these results suggest that ppa/caffeine can lead to cerebral hemorrhage in previously hypertensive animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage. an acute elevation in blood pressure may be a contributing factor.";1;0;0;0
immunohistochemical studies with antibodies to neurofilament proteins on axonal damage in experimental focal lesions in rat.;immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament (nf) proteins of middle and high molecular weight class, nf-m and nf-h, was used to study axonal injury in the borderzone of focal lesions in rats. focal injury in the cortex was produced by infusion of lactate at acid ph or by stab caused by needle insertion. infarcts in substantia nigra pars reticulata were evoked by prolonged pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. immunohistochemical staining for nfs showed characteristic terminal clubs of axons in the borderzone of lesions. differences in the labelling pattern occurred with different antibodies which apparently depended on molecular weight class of nfs and phosphorylation state. these immunohistochemical changes of nfs can serve as a marker for axonal damage in various experimental traumatic or ischemic lesions.;0;0;1;0

differential effects of 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: therapeutic implications.;increasing recognition of the importance of calcium in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has stimulated research into the use of calcium channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. the favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities. clinical applications of calcium channel blockers parallel their tissue selectivity. in contrast to verapamil and diltiazem, which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue. as the first dihydropyridine available for use in the united states, nifedipine controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function. additional members of this group of calcium channel blockers have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therapy. once or twice daily dosage possible with nitrendipine and nisoldipine offers a convenient administration schedule, which encourages patient compliance in long-term therapy of hypertension. the coronary vasodilating properties of nisoldipine have led to the investigation of this agent for use in angina. selectivity for the cerebrovascular bed makes nimodipine potentially useful in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage, migraine headache, dementia, and stroke. in general, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are usually well tolerated, with headache, facial flushing, palpitations, edema, nausea, anorexia, and dizziness being the more common adverse effects.;1;0;1;0
treatment of crohn's disease with fusidic acid: an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclosporin.;fusidic acid is an antibiotic with t-cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin. because of the need for the development of new treatments for crohn's disease, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients. eight crohn's disease patients were included. fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks. the disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score. five of 8 patients (63%) improved during fusidic acid treatment: 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks. there were no serious clinical side effects, but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea. biochemically, an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases (63%), and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment. all reversed to pre-treatment levels after cessation of treatment. the results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active crohn's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective. because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease, we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated.;0;0;1;0

the use and toxicity of didanosine (ddi) in hiv antibody-positive individuals intolerant to zidovudine (azt);"one hundred and fifty-one patients intolerant to zidovudine (azt) received didanosine (ddi) to a maximum dose of 12.5 mg/kg/day. patient response was assessed using changes in cd4+ lymphocyte subset count, hiv p24 antigen, weight, and quality of life. seventy patients developed major opportunistic infections whilst on therapy; this was the first aids diagnosis in 17. only minor changes in cd4+ lymphocyte subset count were observed in aids patients, although a more significant rise occurred in those with earlier stages of disease. of those positive for p24 antigen at the commencement of the study 67% showed a positive response, and this was most likely in those with cd4+ lymphocyte subset counts above 100 mm3. a positive weight response was seen in 16% of patients. most patients showed improvement in individual parameters and global score of quality of life. adverse reactions possibly attributable to didanosine were common. the most common side-effect was diarrhoea, which resulted in cessation of therapy in 19 individuals. peripheral neuropathy occurred in 12 patients and pancreatitis in six. thirteen patients developed a raised serum amylase without abdominal pain. seven patients developed glucose tolerance curves characteristic of diabetes but these were mild, did not require treatment and returned to normal on ceasing didanosine.";0;0;1;0
systemic toxicity and resuscitation in bupivacaine-, levobupivacaine-, or ropivacaine-infused rats.;we compared the systemic toxicity of bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine in anesthetized rats. we also compared the ability to resuscitate rats after lethal doses of these local anesthetics. bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, or ropivacaine was infused at a rate of 2 mg. kg(-1). min(-1) while electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and arterial pressure were continuously monitored. when asystole was recorded, drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was begun. epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg was administered at 1-min intervals while external cardiac compressions were applied. resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure > or =100 mm hg was achieved within 5 min. the cumulative doses of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine that produced seizures were similar and were larger than those of bupivacaine. the cumulative doses of levobupivacaine that produced dysrhythmias and asystole were smaller than the corresponding doses of ropivacaine, but they were larger than those of bupivacaine. the number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups. however, a smaller dose of epinephrine was required in the ropivacaine group than in the other groups. we conclude that the systemic toxicity of levobupivacaine is intermediate between that of ropivacaine and bupivacaine when administered at the same rate and that ropivacaine-induced cardiac arrest appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by bupivacaine or levobupivacaine.;1;0;1;0

differential modulation by estrogen of alpha2-adrenergic and i1-imidazoline receptor-mediated hypotension in female rats.;we have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine (mixed alpha2-/i1-receptor agonist) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction. the present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2- and/or i1-receptors. changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine (600 microg/kg) or alpha-methyldopa (100 mg/kg), selective i1- and alpha2-receptor agonists, respectively, in blood pressure, hemodynamic variability, and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham-operated and ovariectomized (ovx) sprague-dawley female rats with or without 12-wk estrogen replacement. three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed: the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (sdrr) and the root mean square of successive differences in r-wave-to-r-wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability. in sham-operated rats, rilmenidine or alpha-methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure. sdrr was reduced only by alpha-methyldopa. ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha-methyldopa, in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension. the enhanced alpha-methyldopa hypotension in ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in sdrr and a reduced locomotor activity. estrogen replacement (17beta-estradiol subcutaneous pellet, 14.2 microg/day, 12 wk) of ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha-methyldopa to sham-operated levels. these findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2- but not i1-receptor-mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha-methyldopa-estrogen interaction.;1;0;0;0
susceptibility to seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats after microinjection of isoniazid or gamma-vinyl-gaba into the substantia nigra.;pilocarpine, given intraperitoneally to rats, reproduces the neuropathological sequelae of temporal lobe epilepsy and provides a relevant animal model for studying mechanisms of buildup of convulsive activity and pathways operative in the generalization and propagation of seizures within the forebrain. in the present study, the effects of manipulating the activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba)-mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats, were investigated. in animals pretreated with microinjections of isoniazid, 150 micrograms, an inhibitor of activity of the gaba-synthesizing enzyme, l-glutamic acid decarboxylase, into the substantia nigra pars reticulata (snr), bilaterally, non-convulsant doses of pilocarpine, 100 and 200 mg/kg, resulted in severe motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus. electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring revealed a profound reduction of the threshold for pilocarpine-induced convulsions. morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy revealed seizure-related damage to the hippocampal formation, thalamus, amygdala, olfactory cortex, substantia nigra and neocortex, which is typically observed with pilocarpine in doses exceeding 350 mg/kg. bilateral intrastriatal injections of isoniazid did not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine, 200 mg/kg. application of an irreversible inhibitor of gaba transaminase, gamma-vinyl-gaba (d,l-4-amino-hex-5-enoic acid), 5 micrograms, into the snr, bilaterally, suppressed the appearance of electrographic and behavioral seizures produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. this treatment was also sufficient to protect animals from the occurrence of brain damage. microinjections of gamma-vinyl-gaba, 5 micrograms, into the dorsal striatum, bilaterally, failed to prevent the development of convulsions produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. the results demonstrate that the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats is subjected to the regulation of the gaba-mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra.;0;1;1;0

increased frequency and severity of angio-oedema related to long-term therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in two patients.;adverse reactions to drugs are well recognized as a cause of acute or chronic urticaria, and angio-oedema. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure, were introduced in europe in the middle of the eighties, and the use of these drugs has increased progressively. soon after the introduction of ace inhibitors, acute bouts of angio-oedema were reported in association with the use of these drugs. we wish to draw attention to the possibility of adverse reactions to ace inhibitors after long-term use and in patients with pre-existing angio-oedema.;1;0;0;0
minocycline-induced vasculitis fulfilling the criteria of polyarteritis nodosa.;a 47-year-old man who had been taking minocycline for palmoplantar pustulosis developed fever, myalgias, polyneuropathy, and testicular pain, with elevated c-reactive protein (crp). neither myeloperoxidase- nor proteinase-3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was positive. these manifestations met the american college of rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of polyarteritis nodosa. stopping minocycline led to amelioration of symptoms and normalization of crp level. to our knowledge, this is the second case of minocycline-induced vasculitis satisfying the criteria. differential diagnosis for drug-induced disease is invaluable even for patients with classical polyarteritis nodosa.;0;0;1;0

duchenne/becker muscular dystrophy: correlation of phenotype by electroretinography with sites of dystrophin mutations.;the dark-adapted electroretinogram ( erg ) of patients with duchenne and becker muscular dystrophy ( dmd / bmd ) shows a marked reduction in b-wave amplitude . genotype-phenotype studies of mouse models for dmd show position-specific effects of the mutations upon the phenotype  mice with 5 defects of dystrophin have normal ergs , those with defects in the central region have a normal b-wave amplitude associated with prolonged implicit times for both the b-wave and oscillatory potentials , and mice with 3 defects have a phenotype similar to that seen in  dmd / bmd patients . the mouse studies suggest a key role for the carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform , dp260 , in retinal electrophysiology . we have undertaken a systematic evaluation of dmd / bmd patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position-specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man . we have found that , in man , a wider variation of dmd defects correlate with reductions in the b-wave amplitude . individuals with normal ergs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of dp260 . our results suggest that the most important determinant in the erg b-wave phenotype is the mutation position , rather than muscle disease severity . forty-six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ergs , as opposed to 94 % with more distal mutations . the human genotype-phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other c-terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission . .;0;0;1;0

serotonergic drugs, benzodiazepines and baclofen block muscimol-induced myoclonic jerks in a strain of mice.;in male swiss mice, muscimol produced myoclonic jerks. a 3 mg/kg (i.p.) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min. increasing the brain serotonin levels by the administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (80-160 mg/kg) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the muscimol effect. however, in a similar experiment l-dopa (80-160 mg/kg) was without effect. in doses of 3-10 mg/kg, the serotonin receptor agonist mk-212 caused a dose-dependent blockade of the response of muscimol. of the benzodiazepines, clonazepam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg) in blocking the myoclonic jerks. while (-)-baclofen (1-3 mg/kg) proved to be an effective antagonist of muscimol, its (+)-isomer (5-20 mg/kg) lacked this property. considering the fact that 5-htp and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical myoclonus, the muscimol-induced myoclonus seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition. our present study indicated the possible value of mk-212 and (-)-baclofen in the management of clinical myoclonus.;0;0;1;0
intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children.;"background: adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. the incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. there are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir. ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both rna and dna viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis c. intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. the most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. the use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. objective: we report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. design/methods: we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease. two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. the bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease. an additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial digeorge syndrome. the remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant. intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. results: complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. the remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease. intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated. use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia. discussion: our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. conclusions: two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered. the availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible. given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.";0;1;0;0

mechanisms for protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin-mediated nephropathy in rats.;studies were performed to examine the mechanisms for the protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin (gm)-mediated nephropathy. administration of gm at 40 mg/kg sc for 13 days to rats induced a significant reduction in renal blood flow (rbf) and inulin clearance (cin) as well as marked tubular damage. a significant reduction in urinary guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cgmp) excretion and a significant increase in renal cortical renin and endothelin-1 contents were also observed in gm-mediated nephropathy. superoxide dismutase (sod) or dimethylthiourea (dmtu) significantly lessened the gm-induced decrement in cin. the sod-induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in rbf, an increase in urinary cgmp excretion, and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin-1 content. sod did not attenuate the tubular damage. in contrast, dmtu significantly reduced the tubular damage and lipid peroxidation, but it did not affect renal hemodynamics and vasoactive substances. neither sod nor dmtu affected the renal cortical gm content in gm-treated rats. these results suggest that 1) both sod and dmtu have protective effects on gm-mediated nephropathy, 2) the mechanisms for the protective effects differ for sod and dmtu, and 3) superoxide anions play a critical role in gm-induced renal vasoconstriction.;0;1;1;0

the cytogenetic action of ifosfamide, mesna, and their combination on peripheral rabbit lymphocytes: an in vivo/in vitro cytogenetic study.;ifosfamide (ifo) is an alkylating nitrogen mustard, administrated as an antineoplasmic agent. it is characterized by its intense urotoxic action, leading to hemorrhagic cystitis. this side effect of ifo raises the requirement for the co-administration with sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (mesna) aiming to avoid or minimize this effect. ifo and mesna were administrated separately on rabbit's lymphocytes in vivo, which were later developed in vitro. cytogenetic markers for sister chromatid exchanges (sces), proliferation rate index (pri) and mitotic index were recorded. mesna's action, in conjunction with ifo reduces the frequency of sces, in comparison with the sces recordings obtained when ifo is administered alone. in addition to this, when high concentrations of mesna were administered alone significant reductions of the pri were noted, than with ifo acting at the same concentration on the lymphocytes. mesna significantly reduces ifo's genotoxicity, while when administered in high concentrations it acts in an inhibitory fashion on the cytostatic action of the drug.;0;0;0;1
delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.;"background: heparin-induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. delayed recognition and treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes. objective: to describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are delayed. design: retrospective case series. setting: three large urban hospitals (with active cardiovascular surgery programs). patients: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom heparin-induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications. measurements: platelet counts, onset of objectively determined thromboembolism, results of heparin-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes. results: patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure--in most cases, with no thrombocytopenia recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications. thromboemboli were venous (12 patients, 7 with pulmonary emboli) or arterial (4 patients) or both. platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation. on readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic heparin, which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 x 10(9) cells/l; mean nadir after heparin re-exposure, 39 x 10(9) cells/l). results of serologic tests for heparin-induced antibodies were positive in all patients. subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants (11 patients), thrombolytic drugs (3 patients), inferior vena cava filters (3 patients) and, eventually, warfarin (11 patients). three patients died. conclusions: delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is increasingly being recognized. to avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider heparin-induced thrombocytopenia whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with thromboembolism; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not heparin, should be initiated.";1;0;1;0
risk of coronary artery disease associated with initial sulphonylurea treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes: a matched case-control study.;"aims: this study sought to assess the risk of developing coronary artery disease (cad) associated with initial treatment of type 2 diabetes with different sulphonylureas. methods: in type 2 diabetic patients, cases who developed cad were compared retrospectively with controls that did not. the 20-year risk of cad at diagnosis of diabetes, using the ukpds risk engine, was used to match cases with controls. results: the 76 cases of cad were compared with 152 controls. the hazard of developing cad (95% ci) associated with initial treatment increased by 2.4-fold (1.3-4.3, p=0.004) with glibenclamide; 2-fold (0.9-4.6, p=0.099) with glipizide; 2.9-fold (1.6-5.1, p=0.000) with either, and was unchanged with metformin. the hazard decreased 0.3-fold (0.7-1.7, p=0.385) with glimepiride, 0.4-fold (0.7-1.3, p=0.192) with gliclazide, and 0.4-fold (0.7-1.1, p=0.09) with either. conclusions: initiating treatment of type 2 diabetes with glibenclamide or glipizide is associated with increased risk of cad in comparison to gliclazide or glimepiride. if confirmed, this may be important because most indian patients receive the cheaper older sulphonylureas, and present guidelines do not distinguish between individual agents.";1;0;1;0
the relationship between hippocampal acetylcholine release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal seizure-prone and withdrawal seizure-resistant selected mouse lines.;background: the septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis, and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents, but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal severity. thus, the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity. methods: cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol-na  ve withdrawal seizure-prone (wsp) and-resistant (wsr) mice. animals were administered nicotine, carbachol, or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion, and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose. we also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium-stimulated acetylcholine (ach) release in the ca1 region of the hippocampus. potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice, separated by 75 min. hippocampal ach also was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions. results: sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine, carbachol, and neostigmine were significantly greater in wsr versus wsp mice. in microdialysis experiments, the lines did not differ in basal release of ach, and 50 mm kcl increased ach output in both lines of mice. however, the increase in release of ach produced by the first application of kcl was 2-fold higher in wsp versus wsr mice. when hippocampal ach was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions, extracellular ach was significantly elevated (192%) in wsp mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in wsr mice. conclusions: these results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal. specifically, wsp mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with wsr because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons.;0;0;1;0

long-term efficacy and toxicity of high-dose amiodarone therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.;amiodarone was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (vt) (n = 118) or a cardiac arrest (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. the loading dose was 800 mg/day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg/day. sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic vt or ventricular fibrillation (vf) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of vt and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug. one or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51% of patients. adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of amiodarone in 41% and discontinuation of amiodarone in 10% of patients. the most common symptomatic adverse reactions were tremor or ataxia (35%), nausea and anorexia (8%), visual halos or blurring (6%), thyroid function abnormalities (6%) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (5%). although large-dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long-term treatment of vt or vf refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50% of patients. however, when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects, 75% of patients with vt or vf can be successfully managed with amiodarone.;0;0;1;0

hydroxytyrosol ameliorates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats with breast cancer.;oxidative stress is involved in several processes including cancer, aging and cardiovascular disease, and has been shown to potentiate the therapeutic effect of drugs such as doxorubicin. doxorubicin causes significant cardiotoxicity characterized by marked increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. herein, we investigate whether doxorubicin-associated chronic cardiac toxicity can be ameliorated with the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol in rats with breast cancer. thirty-six rats bearing breast tumors induced chemically were divided into 4 groups: control, hydroxytyrosol (0.5mg/kg, 5days/week), doxorubicin (1mg/kg/week), and doxorubicin plus hydroxytyrosol. cardiac disturbances at the cellular and mitochondrial level, mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes i-iv and apoptosis-inducing factor, and oxidative stress markers have been analyzed. hydroxytyrosol improved the cardiac disturbances enhanced by doxorubicin by significantly reducing the percentage of altered mitochondria and oxidative damage. these results suggest that hydroxytyrosol improve the mitochondrial electron transport chain. this study demonstrates that hydroxytyrosol protect rat heart damage provoked by doxorubicin decreasing oxidative damage and mitochondrial alterations.;1;0;0;1

use of chromosome substitution strains to identify seizure susceptibility loci in mice.;seizure susceptibility varies among inbred mouse strains. chromosome substitution strains (css), in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain (donor) has been transferred onto a second strain (host) by repeated backcrossing, may be used to identify quantitative trait loci (qtls) that contribute to seizure susceptibility. qtls for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, have not been reported, and css have not previously been used to localize seizure susceptibility genes. we report qtls identified using a b6 (host) x a/j (donor) css panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures. three hundred fifty-five adult male css mice, 58 b6, and 39 a/j were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures. highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice. b6 mice were resistant to seizures and slower to reach stages compared to a/j mice. the css for chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages, diverging dramatically from the b6 phenotype. latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for css10 and css18 mice. css mapping suggests seizure susceptibility loci on mouse chromosomes 10 and 18. this approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy.;0;0;1;0

antituberculosis therapy-induced acute liver failure: magnitude, profile, prognosis, and predictors of outcome.;"antituberculosis therapy (att)-associated acute liver failure (att-alf) is the commonest drug-induced alf in south asia. prospective studies on att-alf are lacking. the current study prospectively evaluated the magnitude, clinical course, outcome, and prognostic factors in att-alf. from january 1986 to january 2009, 1223 consecutive alf patients were evaluated: att alone was the cause in 70 (5.7%) patients. another 15 (1.2%) had att and simultaneous hepatitis virus infection. in 44 (62.8%) patients, att was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of tuberculosis. att-alf patients were younger (32.87 [+/-15.8] years), and 49 (70%) of them were women. most had hyperacute presentation; the median icterus encephalopathy interval was 4.5 (0-30) days. the median duration of att before alf was 30 (7-350) days. at presentation, advanced encephalopathy and cerebral edema were present in 51 (76%) and 29 (41.4%) patients, respectively. gastrointestinal bleed, seizures, infection, and acute renal failure were documented in seven (10%), five (7.1%), 26 (37.1%), and seven (10%) patients, respectively. compared with hepatitis e virus (hev) and non-a non-e-induced alf, att-alf patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes. the mortality rate among patients with att-alf was high (67.1%, n = 47), and only 23 (32.9%) patients recovered with medical treatment. in multivariate analysis, three factors independently predicted mortality: serum bilirubin (>or=10.8 mg/dl), prothrombin time (pt) prolongation (>or=26 seconds), and grade iii/iv encephalopathy at presentation. conclusion: att-alf constituted 5.7% of alf at our center and had a high mortality rate. because the mortality rate is so high, determining which factors are predictors is less important. a high proportion of patients had consumed att empirically, which could have been prevented.";0;1;1;0

epidural blood flow during prostaglandin e1 or trimethaphan induced hypotension.;to evaluate the effect of prostaglandin e1 (pge1) or trimethaphan (tmp) induced hypotension on epidural blood flow (ebf) during spinal surgery, ebf was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under isoflurane anaesthesia. an initial dose of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of pge1 (15 patients), or 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of tmp (15 patients) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure (map) at about 60 mmhg. the hypotensive drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative procedure. after starting pge1 or tmp, map and rate pressure product (rpp) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values (p < 0.01), and the degree of hypotension due to pge1 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation. heart rate (hr) did not change in either group. ebff did not change during pge1 infusion whereas in the tmp group, ebf decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of tmp (preinfusion: 45.9 +/- 13.9 ml/100g/min. 30 min: 32.3 +/- 9.9 ml/100 g/min (p < 0.05). 60 min: 30 +/- 7.5 ml/100 g/min (p < 0.05)). these results suggest that pge1 may be preferable to tmp for hypotensive anaesthesia in spinal surgery because tmp decreased ebf.;1;0;1;0

anorexigens and pulmonary hypertension in the united states: results from the surveillance of north american pulmonary hypertension.;"background: the use of appetite suppressants in europe has been associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension (pph). recently, fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widely used in the united states but were withdrawn in september 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects. materials and methods: we conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers in north america. data collected on patients seen from september 1, 1996, to december 31, 1997, included the cause of the pulmonary hypertension and its severity. patients with no identifiable cause of pulmonary hypertension were classed as pph. a history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines. results: five hundred seventy-nine patients were studied, 205 with pph and 374 with pulmonary hypertension from other causes (secondary pulmonary hypertension [sph]). the use of anorexigens was common in both groups. however, of the medications surveyed, only the fenfluramines had a significant preferential association with pph as compared with sph (adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 32.4). the association was stronger with longer duration of use when compared to shorter duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users than in remote users. an unexpectedly high (11.4%) number of patients with sph had used anorexigens. conclusion: the magnitude of the association with pph, the increase of association with increasing duration of use, and the specificity for fenfluramines are consistent with previous studies indicating that fenfluramines are causally related to pph. the high prevalence of anorexigen use in patients with sph also raises the possibility that these drugs precipitate pulmonary hypertension in patients with underlying conditions associated with sph.";1;0;0;0
nitric oxide synthase expression in the course of lead-induced hypertension.;we recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species (ros), reduced urinary excretion of no metabolites (nox), and increased no sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead-induced hypertension. this study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary nox in lead-induced hypertension is, in part, due to depressed no synthase (nos) expression. male sprague-dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead-treated group (given lead acetate, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given lead and vitamin e-fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin e-fortified food for 12 weeks. tail blood pressure, urinary nox excretion, plasma malondialdehyde (mda), and endothelial and inducible nos (enos and inos) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured. the lead-treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma mda concentration, a fall in urinary nox excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue enos and inos expression. vitamin e supplementation ameliorated hypertension, lowered plasma mda concentration, and raised urinary nox excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue enos and inos expression. vitamin e supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma mda, or nos expression in the control group. the study also revealed significant inhibition of nos enzymatic activity by lead in cell-free preparations. in conclusion, lead-induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular enos and inos expression. this is, in part, due to ros-mediated no inactivation, lead-associated inhibition of nos activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension.;1;1;0;0

the risks of aprotinin and tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a one-year follow-up of 1188 consecutive patients.;"background: our aim was to investigate postoperative complications and mortality after administration of aprotinin compared to tranexamic acid in an unselected, consecutive cohort. methods: perioperative data from consecutive cardiac surgery patients were prospectively collected between september 2005 and june 2006 in a university-affiliated clinic (n = 1188). during the first 5 mo, 596 patients received aprotinin (group a); in the next 5 mo, 592 patients were treated with tranexamic acid (group t). except for antifibrinolytic therapy, the anesthetic and surgical protocols remained unchanged. results: the pre- and intraoperative variables were comparable between the treatment groups. postoperatively, a significantly higher incidence of seizures was found in group t (4.6% vs 1.2%, p < 0.001). this difference was also significant in the primary valve surgery and the high risk surgery subgroups (7.9% vs 1.2%, p = 0.003; 7.3% vs 2.4%, p = 0.035, respectively). persistent atrial fibrillation (7.9% vs 2.3%, p = 0.020) and renal failure (9.7% vs 1.7%, p = 0.002) were also more common in group t, in the primary valve surgery subgroup. on the contrary, among primary coronary artery bypass surgery patients, there were more acute myocardial infarctions and renal dysfunction in group a (5.8% vs 2.0%, p = 0.027; 22.5% vs 15.2%, p = 0.036, respectively). the 1-yr mortality was significantly higher after aprotinin treatment in the high risk surgery group (17.7% vs 9.8%, p = 0.034). conclusion: both antifibrinolytic drugs bear the risk of adverse outcome depending on the type of cardiac surgery. administration of aprotinin should be avoided in coronary artery bypass graft and high risk patients, whereas administration of tranexamic acid is not recommended in valve surgery.";1;1;1;0
provocation of postural hypotension by nitroglycerin in diabetic autonomic neuropathy?;the effect of nitroglycerin on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was compared in 5 normal subjects, 12 diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy, and 5 diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy. the magnitude and time course of the increase in heart rate and the decrease in systolic blood pressure after nitroglycerin were similar in the normal and diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy, whereas a lesser increase in heart rate and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in the diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy. it is therefore suggested that caution should be exercised when prescribing vasodilator drugs in diabetic patients, particularly those with autonomic neuropathy.;1;0;1;0

hyperalgesia and myoclonus in terminal cancer patients treated with continuous intravenous morphine.;eight cancer patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous morphine developed hyperalgesia. all cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in copenhagen. five patients developed universal hyperalgesia and hyperesthesia which in 2 cases were accompanied by myoclonus. in 3 patients a pre-existing neuralgia increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases myoclonus occurred simultaneously. although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between hyperalgesia/myoclonus and high doses of morphine are available, experimental support from animal studies indicates that morphine, or its metabolites, plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome. the possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations.;0;0;1;1

dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate-induced narcosis in rats.;melatonin affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced narcosis. sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre-treated with melatonin (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg). melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis, however, no dose-effect correlation was found. in particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis. in contrast, the highest dose of melatonin (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis, and a reduction in mortality rate. melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or diazepam-induced narcosis. thus, the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological narcosis seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action.;0;0;1;0

increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in bladder afferent pathways following chronic bladder irritation.;"immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine alterations in the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nos) in bladder pathways following acute and chronic irritation of the urinary tract of the rat. chemical cystitis was induced by cyclophosphamide (cyp) which is metabolized to acrolein, an irritant eliminated in the urine. injection of cyp (n = 10, 75 mg/kg, i.p.) 2 hours prior to perfusion (acute treatment) of the animals increased fos-immunoreactivity (ir) in neurons in the dorsal commissure, dorsal horn, and autonomic regions of spinal segments (l1-l2 and l6-s1) which receive afferent inputs from the bladder, urethra, and ureter. fos-ir in the spinal cord was not changed in rats receiving chronic cyp treatment (n = 15, 75 mg/kg, i.p., every 3rd day for 2 weeks). in control animals and in animals treated acutely with cyp, only small numbers of nos-ir cells (0.5-0.7 cell profiles/sections) were detected in the l6-s1 dorsal root ganglia (drg). chronic cyp administration significantly (p < or = .002) increased bladder weight by 60% and increased (7- to 11-fold) the numbers of nos-immunoreactive (ir) afferent neurons in the l6-s1 drg. a small increase (1.5-fold) also occurred in the l1 drg, but no change was detected in the l2 and l5 drg. bladder afferent cells in the l6-s1 drg labeled by fluorogold (40 microliters) injected into the bladder wall did not exhibit nos-ir in control animals; however, following chronic cyp administration, a significant percentage of bladder afferent neurons were nos-ir: l6 (19.8 +/- 4.6%) and s1 (25.3 +/- 2.9%). these results indicate that neuronal gene expression in visceral sensory pathways can be upregulated by chemical irritation of afferent receptors in the urinary tract and/or that pathological changes in the urinary tract can initiate chemical signals that alter the chemical properties of visceral afferent neurons.";0;0;1;0
conversion to sirolimus ameliorates cyclosporine-induced nephropathy in the rat: focus on serum, urine, gene, and protein renal expression biomarkers.;protocols of conversion from cyclosporin a (csa) to sirolimus (srl) have been widely used in immunotherapy after transplantation to prevent csa-induced nephropathy, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these protocols remain nuclear. this study aimed to identify the molecular pathways and putative biomarkers of csa-to-srl conversion in a rat model. four animal groups (n = 6) were tested during 9 weeks: control, csa, srl, and conversion (csa for 3 weeks followed by srl for 6 weeks). classical and emergent serum, urinary, and kidney tissue (gene and protein expression) markers were assessed. renal lesions were analyzed in hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-schiff, and masson's trichrome stains. srl-treated rats presented proteinuria and ngal (serum and urinary) as the best markers of renal impairment. short csa treatment presented slight or even absent kidney lesions and tgf-b, nf- kb, mtor, pcna, tp53, kim-1, and ctgf as relevant gene and protein changes. prolonged csa exposure aggravated renal damage, without clear changes on the traditional markers, but with changes in serums tgf- b and il-7, tbars clearance, and kidney tgf-b and mtor. conversion to srl prevented csa-induced renal damage evolution (absent/mild grade lesions), while ngal (serum versus urine) seems to be a feasible biomarker of csa replacement to srl.;0;1;1;0

angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor-associated angioedema of the stomach and small intestine: a case report.;this is a case report on a 45-year old african-american female with newly diagnosed hypertension, who was started on a combination pill of amlodipine/benazapril 10/5 mg. the very next day, she presented at the emergency room (er) with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. physical exam, complete metabolic panel, and hemogram were in the normal range. she was discharged from the er after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics. however, she returned to the er the next day with the same complaints. this time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion. ct scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach, duodenum and jejunum, along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (acei)-induced angioedema was suspected, and anti-hypertensive medications were discontinued. her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours, and repeat ct after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of ascites. the recognition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) and angiotensin receptor blocker (arb) intestinal angioedema constitutes a challenge to primary care physicians, internists, emergency room personal and surgeons.;1;0;1;0
localization of the region homologous to the duchenne muscular dystrophy locus on the mouse x chromosome.;recent progress has resulted in part of the gene mutated in duchenne and the milder becker muscular dystrophies being cloned and has suggested that the gene itself extends over 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 kilobases ( kb ) . to study how mutations in this gene affect muscle development and integrity , it would be of interest to have available a mouse model of the human disease . the mouse mdx mutation affects muscle and confers a mild dystrophic syndrome , but it is not clear whether this mutation is equivalent to duchenne / becker muscular dystrophy in man . here we describe the use of two sequences from the human duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) gene that cross-hybridize to mouse x-linked sequences to localize the gene homologous to dmd in the mouse . both sequences map to the region of 10 centimorgan lying between the tabby ( ta ) and st14-1 ( dxpas8 ) loci , close to the phosphorylase b kinase locus ( phk ) . by analogy with the human x-chromosome , we conclude that the region in the mouse around the g6pd and st14-1 loci may contain two genes corresponding to distinct human myopathies  emery dreifuss muscular dystrophy which is known to be closely linked to st14-1 in man and the dmd homologue described here . .;0;0;1;0
gemcitabine plus vinorelbine in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma patients age 70 years or older or patients who cannot receive cisplatin. oncopaz cooperative group.;"background: although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (nsclc) is high among elderly patients, few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients. recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine (vnb) or gemcitabine (gem) may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. in the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of gem and vnb in elderly patients with advanced nsclc or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed. methods: forty-nine patients with advanced nsclc were included, 38 of whom were age >/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin. all patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. treatment was comprised of vnb, 25 mg/m(2), plus gem, 1000 mg/m(2), both on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected. results: one hundred sixty-five courses were administered, with a median of 3. 6 courses per patient. the overall response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 15-41%). two patients attained a complete response (4%) and 11 patients (22%) achieved a partial response. eastern cooperative oncology group performance status improved in 35% of those patients with an initial value > 0, whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients (55%). the median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1-year survival rate was 33%. toxicity was mild. six patients (12%) had world health organization grade 3-4 neutropenia, 2 patients (4%) had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, and 2 patients (4%) had grade 3 neurotoxicity. three patients with severe neutropenia (6%) died of sepsis. the median age of those patients developing grade 3-4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients (75 years vs. 72 years; p = 0.047). conclusions: the combination of gem and vnb is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age >/= 75 years. this age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression. therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment. new chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced nsclc.";0;0;1;1

protective efficacy of neuroactive steroids against cocaine kindled-seizures in mice.;neuroactive steroids demonstrate pharmacological actions that have relevance for a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. they offer protection against seizures in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of drug dependence in preclinical assessments. the present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba(a)) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration (seizure kindling). allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one), pregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one) and ganaxolone (a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression (anticonvulsant effect) and development (antiepileptogenic effect) of cocaine-kindled seizures in male, swiss-webster mice. kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg/kg cocaine for 5 days. all of these positive gaba(a) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures, whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling. allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, but not ganaxolone, also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling. these findings demonstrate that some neuroactive steroids attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of cocaine and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of drugs of abuse.;0;0;1;0

delayed leukoencephalopathy with stroke-like presentation in chemotherapy recipients.;background: a transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy, most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leukaemia. recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration. methods: we reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke-like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. we only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data. patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded. results: we identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate (intrathecal, systemic), 5-fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur, and capecitabine. diffusion weighted imaging (dwi) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) maps (available in 21/27 patients). lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalisation of adc abnormalities. however, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (flair) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities. conclusions: several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed. dwi findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome.;0;0;1;0
tetany and rhabdomyolysis due to surreptitious furosemide--importance of magnesium supplementation.;diuretics may induce hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. while severe hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness, severe hypomagnesemia is associated with muscle spasms and tetany which cannot be corrected by potassium and calcium supplementation alone (1,2). surreptitious diuretic ingestion has been described, mainly in women who are concerned that they are obese or edematous. symptomatic hypokalemia has been reported in such patients (3-7) and in one case hypocalcemia was observed (8), but the effects of magnesium depletion were not noted in these patients.;0;0;1;0
absence of pkc-alpha attenuates lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.;"lithium, an effective antipsychotic, induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ndi) in  40% of patients. the decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the camp pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter (ut-a1) and water channel (aqp2) expression in the inner medulla. targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as pkc-mediated signaling, may be an effective method of treating lithium-induced polyuria. pkc-alpha null mice (pkca ko) and strain-matched wild type (wt) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3 or 5 days. wt mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas pkca ko mice had no change in urine output or concentration. western blot analysis revealed that aqp2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in wt mice; however, aqp2 was unchanged in pkca ko. similar results were observed with ut-a1 expression. animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks. lithium-treated wt mice had 19-fold increased urine output whereas treated pkca ko animals had a 4-fold increase in output. aqp2 and ut-a1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium-treated wt animals whereas in treated pkca ko mice, aqp2 was only reduced by 2-fold and ut-a1 expression was unaffected. urinary sodium, potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium-fed wt but not in lithium-fed pkca ko mice. our data show that ablation of pkca preserves aqp2 and ut-a1 protein expression and localization in lithium-induced ndi, and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy.";0;1;0;0
inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial-portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback.;nitroprusside-induced hypotension evokes acth secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (ircrf) into the hypophysial-portal circulation. portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradigm. application of a delayed feedback signal, in the form of a 2-h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane-anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis, is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose tested. resting ircrf levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate, which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms/dl. suppression of ircrf secretion in response to nitroprusside-induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8-12 micrograms/dl. these studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of ircrf release.;0;0;1;0

analgesic effect of intravenous ketamine in cancer patients on morphine therapy: a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover, double-dose study.;"pain not responsive to morphine is often problematic. animal and clinical studies have suggested that n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonists, such as ketamine, may be effective in improving opioid analgesia in difficult pain syndromes, such as neuropathic pain. a slow bolus of subhypnotic doses of ketamine (0.25 mg/kg or 0.50 mg/kg) was given to 10 cancer patients whose pain was unrelieved by morphine in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, double-dose study. pain intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical scale; nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, and dry mouth, using a scale from 0 to 3 (not at all, slight, a lot, awful); mini-mental state examination (mmse) (0-30); and arterial pressure were recorded before administration of drugs (t0) and after 30 minutes (t30), 60 minutes (t60), 120 minutes (t120), and 180 minutes (t180). ketamine, but not saline solution, significantly reduced the pain intensity in almost all the patients at both doses. this effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses. hallucinations occurred in 4 patients, and an unpleasant sensation (""empty head"") was also reported by 2 patients. these episodes reversed after the administration of diazepam 1 mg intravenously. significant increases in drowsiness were reported in patients treated with ketamine in both groups and were more marked with ketamine 0.50 mg/kg. a significant difference in mmse was observed at t30 in patients who received 0.50 mg/kg of ketamine. ketamine can improve morphine analgesia in difficult pain syndromes, such as neuropathic pain. however, the occurrence of central adverse effects should be taken into account, especially when using higher doses. this observation should be tested in studies of prolonged ketamine administration.";0;0;1;1

increased frequency of venous thromboembolism with the combination of docetaxel and thalidomide in patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer.;study objective: to evaluate the frequency of venous thromboembolism (vte) in patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer who were treated with docetaxel alone or in combination with thalidomide. design: retrospective analysis of a randomized phase ii trial. setting: national institutes of health clinical research center. patients: seventy men, aged 50-80 years, with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. intervention: each patient received either intravenous docetaxel 30 mg/m2/week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 week off, or the combination of continuous oral thalidomide 200 mg every evening plus the same docetaxel regimen. this 4-week cycle was repeated until there was evidence of excessive toxicity or disease progression. measurements and main results: none of 23 patients who received docetaxel alone developed vte, whereas 9 of 47 patients (19%) who received docetaxel plus thalidomide developed vte (p=0.025). conclusion: the addition of thalidomide to docetaxel in the treatment of prostate cancer significantly increases the frequency of vte. clinicians should be aware of this potential complication when adding thalidomide to chemotherapeutic regimens.;0;0;0;1
recurrent reversible acute renal failure from amphotericin.;a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis and disseminated sporotrichosis developed acute renal failure immediately following the administration of amphotericin b on four separate occasions. the abruptness of the renal failure and its reversibility within days suggests that there was a functional component to the renal dysfunction. we propose that amphotericin, in the setting of reduced effective arterial volume, may activate tubuloglomerular feedback, thereby contributing to acute renal failure.;0;1;0;0

early infections in kidney, heart, and liver transplant recipients on cyclosporine.;eighty-one renal, seventeen heart, and twenty-four liver transplant patients were followed for infection. seventeen renal patients received azathioprine (aza) and prednisone as part of a randomized trial of immunosuppression with 21 cyclosporine-and-prednisone-treated renal transplant patients. all others received cyclosporine and prednisone. the randomized aza patients had more overall infections (p less than 0.05) and more nonviral infections (p less than 0.02) than the randomized cyclosporine patients. heart and liver patients had more infections than cyclosporine renal patients but fewer infections than the aza renal patients. there were no infectious deaths in renal transplant patients on cyclosporine or aza, but infection played a major role in 3 out of 6 cardiac transplant deaths and in 8 out of 9 liver transplant deaths. renal patients on cyclosporine had the fewest bacteremias. analysis of site of infection showed a preponderance of abdominal infections in liver patients, intrathoracic infections in heart patients, and urinary tract infections in renal patients. pulmonary infections were less common in cyclosporine-treated renal patients than in aza-treated patients (p less than 0.05). aza patients had significantly more staphylococcal infections than all other transplant groups (p less than 0.005), and systemic fungal infections occurred only in the liver transplant group. cytomegalovirus (cmv) shedding or serological rises in antibody titer, or both occurred in 78% of cyclosporine patients and 76% of aza patients. of the cyclosporine patients, 15% had symptoms related to cmv infection. serological evidence for epstein barr virus infection was found in 20% of 65 cyclosporine patients studied. three had associated symptoms, and one developed a lymphoma.;1;1;1;1

effect of fucoidan treatment on collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage in rats.;inflammatory cells are postulated to mediate some of the brain damage following ischemic stroke. intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with more inflammation than ischemic stroke. we tested the sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan, which has been reported to reduce inflammatory brain damage, in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus. rats were treated with seven day intravenous infusion of fucoidan (30 micrograms h-1) or vehicle. the hematoma was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging. motor behavior, passive avoidance, and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks. fucoidan-treated rats exhibited evidence of impaired blood clotting and hemodilution, had larger hematomas, and tended to have less inflammation in the vicinity of the hematoma after three days. they showed significantly more rapid improvement of motor function in the first week following hemorrhage and better memory retention in the passive avoidance test. acute white matter edema and eventual neuronal loss in the striatum adjacent to the hematoma did not differ between the two groups. investigation of more specific anti-inflammatory agents and hemodiluting agents are warranted in intracerebral hemorrhage.;0;0;1;0

proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-(pr3-anca) positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis after restarting sulphasalazine treatment.;a 59-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis developed red eyes, pleural effusion, eosinophilia and urinary abnormalities after restarting of sulphasalazine treatment. light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement. proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pr3-anca) titer was elevated at 183 elisa units (eu) in sera (normal range less than 10 eu), myeloperoxidase-anca was negative. pr3-anca titer was 250 and 1,070 eu in pleural effusions on right and left side, respectively. although cessation of sulphasalazine treatment resulted in improvements in fever, red eyes, chest pain, titer of c-reactive protein and volume of the pleural effusions, we initiated steroid therapy, because pr3-anca titer rose to 320 eu, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the pleural effusion remained. one month after steroid therapy, the pleural effusion disappeared, and pr3-anca titer normalized 3 months later. this case suggests that sulphasalazine can induce pr3-anca-positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis.;0;1;0;0
increased expression and apical targeting of renal enac subunits in puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats.;"nephrotic syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized edema. however, the molecular basis for the decreased renal sodium excretion remains undefined. we hypothesized that epithelial na channel (enac) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium retention. an experimental group of rats was treated with puromycin aminonucleoside (pan; 180 mg/kg iv), whereas the control group received only vehicle. after 7 days, pan treatment induced significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and extensive ascites. the protein abundance of alpha-enac and beta-enac was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (isom) and in the inner medulla (im) but was not altered in the cortex. gamma-enac abundance was increased in the cortex, isom, and im. immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-enac, beta-enac, and gamma-enac subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (dct2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments. immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha-enac in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of pan-treated rats, indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha-enac subunits. in contrast, the protein abundances of na(+)/h(+) exchanger type 3 (nhe3), na(+)-k(+)-2cl(-) cotransporter (bsc-1), and thiazide-sensitive na(+)-cl(-) cotransporter (tsc) were decreased. moreover, the abundance of the alpha(1)-subunit of the na-k-atpase was decreased in the cortex and isom, but it remained unchanged in the im. in conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of enac subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the dct2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with pan-induced nephrotic syndrome. the decreased abundance of nhe3, bsc-1, tsc, and na-k-atpase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion.";0;1;0;0

inappropriate use of carbamazepine and vigabatrin in typical absence seizures.;carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures. of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only, eight were erroneously treated with carbamazepine either as monotherapy or as an add-on. vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children. frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic jerks, which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine. absences were aggravated in both cases where vigabatrin was added on to concurrent treatment. optimal control of the absences was achieved with sodium valproate, lamotrigine, or ethosuximide alone or in combination.;0;0;1;0
dna restriction fragments associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin indicate a single origin for deficiency allele pi z.;the alpha 1-protease inhibitor , or alpha-antitrypsin ( aat ) , a major plasma inhibitor of leukocyte elastase and bacterial proteases , is encoded at the pi locus on chromosome 14 ( 14q24 . 3-q32 . 1 ) . a deficiency of aat in individuals homozygous for the pi z allele occurs in about 1 in 2 , 000-8 , 000 caucasians and is associated with an increased risk of early adult onset emphysema and liver disease in childhood . we have now used dna polymorphisms associated with the aat gene to investigate the origin of the pi z allele . using two genomic probes extending into the 5 and 3 flanking regions , respectively , we have identified eight polymorphic restriction sites . extensive linkage disequilibrium occurs throughout the probed region with the pi z allele , but not with normal pi m alleles . the z allele occurs mainly with one haplotype , indicating a single , relatively recent , origin in caucasians;0;1;1;0
enhanced isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen.;we have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin-angiotensin system (ras) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate. in this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain ras in the cardiac reactivity to the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-ar) agonist isoproterenol (iso). transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen (tgr) were used. in isolated hearts, iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular (lv) pressure and maximal contraction (+dp/dt(max)) in the tgr than in the sprague-dawley (sd) rats. lv hypertrophy induced by iso treatment was significantly higher in tgr than in sd rats (in g lv wt/100 g body wt, 0.28 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.004, respectively). the greater lv hypertrophy in tgr rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta-ar and upregulation of lv beta-ar kinase-1 mrna levels compared with those in sd rats. the decrease in the heart rate (hr) induced by the beta-ar antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in tgr compared with sd rats (-9.9 +/- 1.7% vs. -18.1 +/- 1.5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on hr was similar in both strains. these results indicate that tgr are more sensitive to beta-ar agonist-induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.;1;0;1;0
clustering of missense mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia gene in a sporadic t-cell leukaemia.;ataxia-telangiectasia ( a-t ) is a recessive multi-system disorder caused by mutations in the atm gene at 11q22-q23 ( ref . 3 ) . the risk of cancer , especially lymphoid neoplasias , is substantially elevated in a-t patients and has long been associated with chromosomal instability . by analysing tumour dna from patients with sporadic t-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( t-pll ) , a rare clonal malignancy with similarities to a mature t-cell leukaemia seen in a-t , we demonstrate a high frequency of atm mutations in t-pll . in marked contrast to the atm mutation pattern in a-t , the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia were missense mutations . these clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain , which is highly conserved in atm-related proteins in mouse , yeast and drosophila . the resulting amino-acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with atp binding or substrate recognition . two of seventeen mutated t-pll samples had a previously reported a-t allele . in contrast , no mutations were detected in the p53 gene , suggesting that this tumour suppressor is not frequently altered in this leukaemia . occasional missense mutations in atm were also found in tumour dna from patients with b-cell non-hodgkins lymphomas ( b-nhl ) and a b-nhl cell line . the evidence of a significant proportion of loss-of-function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of atm in the majority of mutated tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic t-pll and suggests that atm acts as a tumour suppressor . as constitutional dna was not available , a putative hereditary predisposition to t-pll will require further investigation . .;0;0;1;1

comparison of the effectiveness of ranitidine and cimetidine in inhibiting acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states.;"the h2-histamine receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short- and long-term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states. nineteen patients had zollinger-ellison syndrome, one patient had systemic mastocytosis, and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion. the rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same. the actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents, and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion. however, ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed (1.2 g per day for ranitidine and 3.6 g per day for cimetidine). sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine. treatment with high doses of cimetidine (one to 60 months; median, 11 months) or ranitidine (two to 31 months; median, 14 months) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations, but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy. the results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states. both are safe at high doses, but ranitidine is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of cimetidine.";0;1;0;0

pediatric heart transplantation without chronic maintenance steroids.;from 1986 to february 1993, 40 children aged 2 months to 18 years (average age 10.4 +/- 5.8 years) underwent heart transplantation. indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (52%), congenital heart disease (35%) with and without prior repair (71% and 29%, respectively), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5%), valvular heart disease (3%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (5%). patients were managed with cyclosporine and azathioprine. no prophylaxis with antilymphocyte globulin was used. steroids were given to 39% of patients for refractory rejection, but weaning was always attempted and generally successful (64%). five patients (14%) received maintenance steroids. four patients died in the perioperative period and one died 4 months later. there have been no deaths related to rejection or infection. average follow-up was 36 +/- 19 months (range 1 to 65 months). cumulative survival is 88% at 5 years. in patients less than 7 years of age, rejection was monitored noninvasively. in the first postoperative month, 89% of patients were treated for rejection. freedom from serious infections was 83% at 1 month and 65% at 1 year. cytomegalovirus infections were treated successfully with ganciclovir in 11 patients. no impairment of growth was observed in children who underwent transplantation compared with a control population. twenty-one patients (60%) have undergone annual catheterizations and no sign of graft atherosclerosis has been observed. seizures occurred in five patients (14%) and hypertension was treated in 10 patients (28%). no patient was disabled and no lymphoproliferative disorder was observed.(abstract truncated at 250 words);1;0;1;0

french machado-joseph disease patients do not exhibit gametic segregation distortion: a sperm typing analysis.;segregation distortion has been reported to occur in a number of the trinucleotide repeat disorders . on the basis of a sperm typing study performed in patients of japanese descent with machado-joseph disease ( mjd ) , it was reported that disease alleles are preferentially transmitted during meiosis . we performed a sperm typing study of five mjd patients of french descent and analysis of the pooled data shows a ratio of mutant to normal alleles of 379  436 ( 46 . 5  53 . 5 % ) , which does not support meiotic segregation distortion . to confirm these results , sperm typing analysis was also performed using a polymorphic marker , d14s1050 , closely linked to the mjd1 gene . among 910 sperm analyzed , the allele linked to the disease chromosome was detected in 50 . 3 % of the samples and the allele linked to the normal chromosome was found in 49 . 6 % of the sperm . the difference in frequency of these two alleles is not significant ( p = 0 . 8423 ) . likelihood-based analysis of segregation distortion in the single sperm data using the spermseg program also showed no support for segregation distortion at the gamete level in this patient population . the previous report on the japanese patients also suggested that disease allele stability may be influenced by a trans effect of an intragenic polymorphism ( 987 g / c ) in the wild-type allele . all of the french patients were heterozygous for this polymorphism . however , analysis of the variance in repeat number in sperm from the french mjd patients overlapped significantly with the variance in repeat number observed in the c / c homozygous japanese patients .;0;0;1;0

epidemic of liver disease caused by hydrochlorofluorocarbons used as ozone-sparing substitutes of chlorofluorocarbons.;background: hydrochlorofluorocarbons (hcfcs) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs). limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds. we investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (hcfc 123) and 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (hcfc 124). all nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees. both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (halothane) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates, which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane. we aimed to test whether hcfcs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease. methods: for one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done. the serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome-p450 2e1 (p450 2e1) and p58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform (p58). findings: the liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas (bridging necrosis). trifluoroacetyl-adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes. autoantibodies against p450 2e1 or p58, previously associated with halothane hepatitis, were detected in the serum of five affected workers. interpretation: repeated exposure of human beings to hcfcs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population. although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known, the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl-altered liver proteins are involved. in view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds, there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives.;0;1;0;0
adriamycin-induced autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays a pathogenic role in a rat model of heart failure.;background: the mechanisms underlying heart failure induced by adriamycin are very complicated and still unclear. the aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart failure. methods: 3-methyladenine (3ma), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin. neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from sprague-dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls, an adriamycin-treated group, and a 3ma plus adriamycin-treated group. we then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition (mpt), and na+-k+ atpase activity in vivo. we also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes. in addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using rt-pcr and western blotting in an animal model. results: 3ma significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury. furthermore, adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles, and 3ma strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin-induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles. conclusion: autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in rats induced by adriamycin. mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of heart failure caused by adriamycin via the autophagy pathway.;1;0;1;0

linkage of dna markers at xq28 to adrenoleukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy present within the same family.;we present a large kindred that contained patients with either adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) or adrenomyeloneuropathy ( amn ) . the pedigree clearly supported the x-linked mode of inheritance of the nonneonatal form of ald / amn . analysis with dna markers at xq28 suggested segregation of both ald and amn with an identical haplotype . this indicated that nonneonatal ald and amn are caused by a mutation in the same gene at xq28 . it showed , furthermore , that phenotypic differences between ald and amn are not necessarily the consequence of allelic heterogeneity due to different mutations within the same gene . the maximal lod score for linkage of the ald / amn gene and the multiallelic anonymous dna marker at dxs52 was 3 . 0 at a recombination fraction of 0 . 00 . this made a prenatal or presymptomatic diagnosis and heterozygote detection by dna analysis with this marker reliable .;0;0;1;0

topical 0.025% capsaicin in chronic post-herpetic neuralgia: efficacy, predictors of response and long-term course.;"in order to evaluate the efficacy, time-course of action and predictors of response to topical capsaicin, 39 patients with chronic post-herpetic neuralgia (phn), median duration 24 months, were treated with 0.025% capsaicin cream for 8 weeks. during therapy the patients rated their pain on a visual analogue scale (vas) and a verbal outcome scale. a follow-up investigation was performed 10-12 months after study onset on the patients who had improved. nineteen patients (48.7%) substantially improved after the 8-week trial; 5 (12.8%) discontinued therapy due to side-effects such as intolerable capsaicin-induced burning sensations (4) or mastitis (1); 15 (38.5%) reported no benefit. the decrease in vas ratings was significant after 2 weeks of continuous application. of the responders 72.2% were still improved at the follow-up; only one-third of them had continued application irregularly. treatment effect was not dependent on patient's age, duration or localization of phn (trigeminal involvement was excluded), sensory disturbance or pain character. treatment response was not correlated with the incidence, time-course or severity of capsaicin-induced burning. if confirmed in controlled trials, the long-term results of this open, non-randomized study might indicate that the analgesic effect of capsaicin in phn is mediated by both interference with neuropeptide metabolism and morphological changes (perhaps degeneration) of nociceptive afferents.";0;0;1;0

a novel homeodomain-encoding gene is associated with a large cpg island interrupted by the myotonic dystrophy unstable (ctg)n repeat.;myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) is associated with a ( ctg ) n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of a protein kinase-encoding gene , dmpk , which maps to chromosome 19q13 . 3 . characterisation of the expression of this gene in patient tissues has thus far generated conflicting data on alterations in the steady state levels of dmpk mrna , and on the final dmpk protein levels in the presence of the expansion . the dm region of chromosome 19 is gene rich , and it is possible that the repeat expansion may lead to dysfunction of a number of transcription units in the vicinity , perhaps as a consequence of chromatin disruption . we have searched for genes associated with a cpg island at the 3 end of dmpk . sequencing of this region shows that the island extends over 3 . 5 kb and is interrupted by the ( ctg ) n repeat . comparison of genomic sequences downstream ( centromeric ) of the repeat in human and mouse identified regions of significant homology . these correspond to exons of a gene predicted to encode a homeodomain protein . rt-pcr analysis shows that this gene , which we have called dm locus-associated homeodomain protein ( dmahp ) , is expressed in a number of human tissues , including skeletal muscle , heart and brain .;1;0;1;0

the correlation between neurotoxic esterase inhibition and mipafox-induced neuropathic damage in rats.;the correlation between neuropathic damage and inhibition of neurotoxic esterase or neuropathy target enzyme (nte) was examined in rats acutely exposed to mipafox (n, n'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate), a neurotoxic organophosphate. brain and spinal cord nte activities were measured in long-evans male rats 1 hr post-exposure to various dosages of mipafox (ip, 1-15 mg/kg). these data were correlated with histologically scored cervical cord damage in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14-21 days post-exposure. those dosages (greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg) that inhibited mean nte activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73% and brain greater than or equal to 67% of control values produced severe (greater than or equal to 3) cervical cord pathology in 85% of the rats. in contrast, dosages of mipafox (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean nte activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of cord damage in only 9% of the animals. these data indicate that a critical percentage of nte inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after mipafox exposure can predict neuropathic damage in rats several weeks later.;0;0;1;0

lithium-associated cognitive and functional deficits reduced by a switch to divalproex sodium: a case series.;background: lithium remains a first-line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium, such as polyuria and tremor, more subtle lithium side effects such as cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments remain understudied. this report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to divalproex sodium to alleviate such cognitive and functional impairments. method: open, case series design. results: we report seven cases where substitution of lithium, either fully or partially, with divalproex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive, motivational, or creative deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients. conclusion: in this preliminary report, divalproex sodium was a superior alternative to lithium in bipolar patients experiencing cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments.;0;0;1;0
persistent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus following lithium therapy.;we report the case of a patient who developed severe hypernatraemic dehydration following a head injury. ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and lithium therapy had been discontinued. he remained thirsty and polyuric despite cessation of lithium and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and vasopressin secretion, with clear evidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. lithium induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but polyuria persisted in this patient for ten years after lithium was stopped. we discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.;0;1;1;0
myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm during dobutamine stress echocardiography.;dobutamine stress echocardiography (dse) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischemia. until now, the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery, and positive dse has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. the aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by dobutamine. we performed dse on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. all patients had anginal attacks at rest with st elevation on the electrocardiogram (variant angina). coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine, and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients. dse was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg/kg/min every 5 minutes. of the 51 patients, 7 patients showed asynergy with st elevation. all 7 patients (13.7%) had chest pain during asynergy, and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy. these findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic angina. when dse is performed to evaluate coronary artery disease, not only fixed coronary stenosis, but also coronary spasm should be considered as a genesis of asynergy.;1;0;1;0

invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis following cyclophosphamide therapy for nonmalignant disease.;a 47-year-old woman with right hydroureteronephrosis due to ureterovesical junction obstruction had gross hematuria after being treated for five years wtih cyclophosphamide for cerebral vasculitis. a right nephroureterectomy was required for control of bleeding. the pathology specimen contained clinically occult invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis. although the ability of cyclophosphamide to cause hemorrhagic cystitis and urine cytologic abnormalities indistinguishable from high grade carcinoma is well known, it is less widely appreciated that it is also associated with carcinoma of the urinary tract. twenty carcinomas of the urinary bladder and one carcinoma of the prostate have been reported in association with its use. the present case is the first carcinoma of the renal pelvis reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment. it is the third urinary tract cancer reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment for nonmalignant disease. the association of the tumor with preexisting hydroureteronephrosis suggests that stasis prolonged and intensified exposure of upper urinary tract epithelium to cyclophosphamide. patients who are candidates for long-term cyclophosphamide treatment should be routinely evaluated for obstructive uropathy.;0;1;0;1

age of onset in huntington disease : sex specific influence of apolipoprotein e genotype and normal cag repeat length .;age of onset ( ao ) of huntington disease ( hd) is known to be correlated with the length of an expanded cag repeat in the hd gene . apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) genotype , in turn , is known to influence ao in alzheimer disease , rendering the apoe gene a likely candidate to affect ao in other neurological diseases too . we therefore determined apoe genotype and normal cag repeat length in the hd gene for 138 hd patients who were previously analysed with respect to cag repeat length . genotyping for apoe was performed blind to clinical information . in addition to highlighting the effect of the normal repeat length upon ao in maternally inherited hd and in male patients , we show that the apoe epsilon2epsilon3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier ao in males than in females . such a sex difference in ao was not apparent for any of the other apoe genotypes . our findings suggest that subtle differences in the course of the neurodegeneration  in hd  may allow interacting genes to exert gender specific effects upon ao.;0;0;1;0
5-fluorouracil cardiotoxicity induced by alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine.;"cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) treatment for malignancies. we herein report the case of a 70-year-old man with 5-fu-induced cardiotoxicity, in whom a high serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (fbal) was observed. the patient, who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no cardiac history. after admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fu (1000 mg/day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum fbal concentration of 1955 ng/ml. both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5-fu. as the precordial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5-fu-induced cardiotoxicity, the administration of 5-fu was abandoned. instead, oral administration of s-1 (a derivative of 5-fu), at 200 mg/day twice a week, was instituted, because s-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradative of 5-fu into fbal. the serum fbal concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng/ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of s-1 administration. thereafter, no cardiac symptoms were observed. the patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the s-1 treatment. the experience of this case, together with a review of the literature, suggests that fbal is related to 5-fu-induced cardiotoxicity. s-1 may be administered safely to patients with 5-fu-induced cardiotoxicity.";1;1;1;1

hereditary tp53 codon 292 and somatic p16ink4a codon 94 mutations in a li-fraumeni syndrome family.;"li-fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by various types of cancer in childhood and adult cases . although hereditary tp53 mutation is very rare in different human cancers , it has been frequently reported in li-fraumeni syndrome . on the other hand , hereditary mutations of tp57kip2 , p15ink4b , and p16ink4a , which affect the cell cycle similar to tp53 , were observed in some types of cancer . in a turkish family with the diagnosis of li-fraumeni syndrome , we analyzed the mutation pattern of tp53 , p57kip2 , p15ink4b , and p16ink4a in the peripheral blood , and loss of heterozygosity ( homo / hemizygous deletion ) pattern of tp53 and p15ink4b / p16ink4a in two tumor tissues . the propositus had a seminoma , his daughter a medulloblastoma , and one of his healthy cousins , a tp53 codon 292 missense point mutation ( aaa-- > ata ; lys-- > ile ) in the peripheral blood cells . tumor tissue obtained from the propositus with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the tp53 gene . in the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter , a p16ink4a codon 94 missense point mutation ( gcg-- > gag ; ala-- > glu ) was observed with the hereditary tp53 mutation . p16ink4a codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in li-fraumeni syndrome . no other gene alteration in tp53 , p57kip2 , p15ink4b , and p16ink4a was observed . existence of the p16ink4a mutation and the hereditary tp53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the tp53 gene ( seminoma / medulloblastoma ) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis . the gene alterations in tp53 and p16ink4a genes may be used as tumor markers in our family . .";0;0;0;1

mitomycin c associated hemolytic uremic syndrome.;mitomycin c associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. it consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin c treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. the renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of mitomycin c treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema. renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic hus and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis. the mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin c-induced endothelial cell damage. we describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with mitomycin c and died in pulmonary edema.;0;1;0;1
succinylcholine apnoea: attempted reversal with anticholinesterases.;anticholinesterases were administered in an attempt to antagonize prolonged neuromuscular blockade following the administration of succinylcholine in a patient later found to be homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase. edrophonium 10 mg, given 74 min after succinylcholine, when train-of-four stimulation was characteristic of phase ii block, produced partial antagonism which was not sustained. repeated doses of edrophonium to 70 mg and neostigmine to 2.5 mg did not antagonize or augment the block. spontaneous respiration recommenced 200 min after succinylcholine administration. it is concluded that anticholinesterases are only partially effective in restoring neuromuscular function in succinylcholine apnoea despite muscle twitch activity typical of phase ii block.;0;0;1;0

inhibition of nuclear factor-kappab activation attenuates tubulointerstitial nephritis induced by gentamicin.;background: animals treated with gentamicin can show residual areas of interstitial fibrosis in the renal cortex. this study investigated the expression of nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab), mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases and macrophages in the renal cortex and structural and functional renal changes of rats treated with gentamicin or gentamicin + pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc), an nf-kappab inhibitor. methods: 38 female wistar rats were injected with gentamicin, 40 mg/kg, twice a day for 9 days, 38 with gentamicin + pdtc, and 28 with 0.15 m nacl solution. the animals were killed 5 and 30 days after these injections and the kidneys were removed for histological and immunohistochemical studies. the results of the immunohistochemical studies were scored according to the extent of staining. the fractional interstitial area was determined by morphometry. results: gentamicin-treated rats presented a transitory increase in plasma creatinine levels. increased ed-1, map kinases and nf-kappab staining were also observed in the renal cortex from all gentamicin-treated rats compared to control (p < 0.05). the animals killed on day 30 also presented fibrosis in the renal cortex despite the recovery of renal function. treatment with pdtc reduced the functional and structural changes induced by gentamicin. conclusions: these data show that inhibition of nf-kappab activation attenuates tubulointerstitial nephritis induced by gentamicin.;0;1;0;0

behavioral effects of urotensin-ii centrally administered in mice.;"urotensin-ii (u-ii) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system. intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of u-ii causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion. however, the behavioral effects of centrally administered u-ii have received little attention. in the present study, we tested the effects of i.c.v. injections of u-ii on behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine responses in mice. administration of graded doses of u-ii (1-10,000 ng/mouse) provoked: (1) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole-board test; (2) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black-and-white compartment test, and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus-maze test; and (3) a dose-dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced-swimming test and tail suspension test. intracerebroventricular injection of u-ii also caused an increase in: food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng/mouse, water intake at doses of 100-10,000 ng/mouse, and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng/mouse. whatever was the dose, the central administration of u-ii had no effect on body temperature, nociception, apomorphine-induced penile erection and climbing behavior, and stress-induced plasma corticosterone level. taken together, the present study demonstrates that the central injection of u-ii at doses of 1-10,000 ng/mouse induces anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects in mouse. these data suggest that u-ii may be involved in some aspects of psychiatric disorders.";1;0;1;0

chronic carbamazepine treatment in the rat: efficacy, toxicity, and effect on plasma and tissue folate concentrations.;folate depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug (aed) therapy. carbamazepine (cbz), a commonly used aed, has been implicated in some clinical studies. a rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic cbz treatment on folate concentrations in the rat. in the course of developing this model, a common vehicle, propylene glycol, by itself in high doses, was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain. seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether (hfde) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by cbz than seizures induced by maximal electroshock (mes). oral administration of cbz as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against hfde-induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment. the cbz levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals, however, were below those normally considered protective. this treatment with cbz had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat, and, indeed, the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment.;0;1;1;0
ethacrynic acid-induced convulsions and brain neurotransmitters in mice.;"intracerebroventricular injection of ethacrynic acid (50% convulsive dose; 50 micrograms/mouse) accelerated the synthesis/turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) but suppressed the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid and acetylcholine in mouse brain. these effects were completely antagonized by pretreatment with a glutamate/n-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist, aminophosphonovaleric acid. in ethacrynic acid-induced convulsions, these neurotransmitter systems may be differentially modulated, probably through activation of glutaminergic neurons in the brain.";0;0;1;0

erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin.;objective: to report a case of erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin. case summary: a 13-year-old boy was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin because of suspected septicemia. medications were discontinued when erythema multiforme and congestive heart failure caused by myocarditis occurred. the patient was treated with methylprednisolone and gradually improved. macrophage-migration inhibition (mif) test with ampicillin was positive. discussion: after most infections causing erythema multiforme and myocarditis were ruled out, a drug-induced allergic reaction was suspected. positive mif test for ampicillin showed sensitization of the patient's lymphocytes to ampicillin. conclusions: hypersensitivity myocarditis is a rare and dangerous manifestation of allergy to penicillins.;1;0;0;0
acute renal toxicity of doxorubicin (adriamycin)-loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles.;acute doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticle (dxnp) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis. in normal rats, 2/6 rats given free doxorubicin (dx) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free np or dxnp survived. a 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with dxnp than in those treated with dx. free np did not provoke any proteinuria. two hr post-injection, dxnp was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free dx (p < 0.025). in rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis, 5/6 rats given dx died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by dxnp, np, or untreated, which all survived. proteinuria appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between dxnp and dx. rats treated by unloaded np behaved as controls. these results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, dxnp killed less animals than free dx, despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former. both effects (better survival and nephrosis) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of dxnp by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.;0;1;0;0
theophylline neurotoxicity in pregnant rats.;the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the neurotoxicity of theophylline is altered in advanced pregnancy. sprague-dawley rats that were 20 days pregnant and nonpregnant rats of the same age and strain received infusions of aminophylline until onset of maximal seizures which occurred after 28 and 30 minutes respectively. theophylline concentrations at this endpoint in serum (total) and csf were similar but serum (free) and brain concentrations were slightly different in pregnant rats. theophylline serum protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis was lower in pregnant rats. fetal serum concentrations at onset of seizures in the mother were similar to maternal brain and csf concentrations and correlated significantly with the former. it is concluded that advanced pregnancy has a negligible effect on the neurotoxic response to theophylline in rats.;0;0;1;0
type b hepatitis after needle-stick exposure: prevention with hepatitis b immune globulin. final report of the veterans administration cooperative study.;"hepatitis b immune globulin (hbig) and immune serum globulin (isg) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing type b hepatitis after needle-stick exposure to hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag)-positive donors. clinical hepatitis developed in 1.4% of hbig and in 5.9% of isg recipients (p = 0.016), and seroconversion (anti-hbs) occurred in 5.6% and 20.7% of them respectively (p less than 0.001). mild and transient side-effects were noted in 3.0% of isg and in 3.2% of hbig recipients. available donor sera were examined for dna polymerase (dnap) and e antigen and antibody (hbeag; anti-hbe). both dnap and hbeag showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of hbsag-positive donors. hepatitis b immune globulin remained significantly superior to isg in preventing type b hepatitis even when the analysis was confined to these two high-risk subgroups. the efficacy of isg in preventing type b hepatitis cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included.";0;1;0;0
myotonic dystrophy kinase is a component of neuromuscular junctions.;the clinical manifestation of myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) is correlated to the extent of expansion of an unstable [ ctg ] n dna motif . recent studies have demonstrated that this trinucleotide motif forms part of the last , 3 untranslated exon of a gene which potentially encodes multiple protein isoforms of a serine / threonine protein kinase ( myotonic dystrophy protein kinase , dm-pk ) . we report here on the development of antisera against synthetic dm-pk peptide antigens and their use in biochemical and histochemical studies . immunoreactive dm-kinase protein of 53 kd is present at low levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle extracts of dm patients and normal controls . immunohistochemical staining revealed that dm-pk is localised prominently at sites of neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions ( nmjs and mtjs ) of human and rodent skeletal muscles . furthermore , very low levels of immunoreactive dm-pk protein are present in the sarcoplasm of predominantly type i fibres in various muscles . strikingly , presence of the protein can also be demonstrated for nmjs of muscular tissues of adult and congenital cases of dm , with no gross changes in structural organisation . our findings provide a basis for further characterisation of the role of the kinase in protein assembly processes or signal mediation at synaptic sites and ultimately for the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of dm . .;0;0;1;0

ccnu (lomustine) toxicity in dogs: a retrospective study (2002-07).;objective: to describe the incidence of haematological, renal, hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities in tumour-bearing dogs receiving 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (ccnu). design: the medical records of 206 dogs that were treated with ccnu at the melbourne veterinary specialist centre between february 2002 and december 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. results: of the 206 dogs treated with ccnu, 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of toxicity. ccnu was used most commonly in the treatment of lymphoma, mast cell tumour, brain tumour, histiocytic tumours and epitheliotropic lymphoma. throughout treatment, 56.9% of dogs experienced neutropenia, 34.2% experienced anaemia and 14.2% experienced thrombocytopenia. gastrointestinal toxicosis was detected in 37.8% of dogs, the most common sign of which was vomiting (24.3%). potential renal toxicity and elevated alanine transaminase (alt) concentration were reported in 12.2% and 48.8% of dogs, respectively. the incidence of hepatic failure was 1.2%. conclusions: ccnu-associated toxicity in dogs is common, but is usually not life threatening.;0;1;1;1
hepatocellular oxidant stress following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.;reperfusion of ischemic intestine results in acute liver dysfunction characterized by hepatocellular enzyme release into plasma, reduction in bile flow rate, and neutrophil sequestration within the liver. the pathophysiology underlying this acute hepatic injury is unknown. this study was undertaken to determine whether oxidants are associated with the hepatic injury and to determine the relative value of several indirect methods of assessing oxidant exposure in vivo. rats were subjected to a standardized intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. hepatic tissue was assayed for lipid peroxidation products and oxidized and reduced glutathione. there was no change in hepatic tissue total glutathione following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. oxidized glutathione (gssg) increased significantly following 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. there was no increase in any of the products of lipid peroxidation associated with this injury. an increase in gssg within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion suggests exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress. the lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes. these data also suggest that the measurement of tissue gssg may be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than measurement of products of lipid peroxidation.;0;1;0;0

medical and psychiatric outcomes for patients transplanted for acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure: a case-control study.;"background: acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure (alf) in the uk. patients often consume the drug with suicidal intent or with a background of substance dependence. aims and methods: we compared the severity of pretransplant illness, psychiatric co-morbidity, medical and psychosocial outcomes of all patients who had undergone liver transplantation (lt) emergently between 1999-2004 for acetaminophen-induced alf (n=36) with age- and sex-matched patients undergoing emergent lt for non-acetaminophen-induced alf (n=35) and elective lt for chronic liver disease (cld, n=34). results: acetaminophen-induced alf patients undergoing lt had a greater severity of pre-lt illness reflected by higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii scores and requirement for organ support compared with the other two groups. twenty (56%) acetaminophen-induced alf patients had a formal psychiatric diagnosis before lt (non-acetaminophen-induced alf=0/35, cld=2/34; p<0.01 for all) and nine (25%) had a previous suicide attempt. during follow-up (median 5 years), there were no significant differences in rejection (acute and chronic), graft failure or survival between the groups (acetaminophen-induced alf 1 year 87%, 5 years 75%; non-acetaminophen-induced alf 88%, 78%; cld 93%, 82%: p>0.6 log rank). two acetaminophen-induced alf patients reattempted suicide post-lt (one died 8 years post-lt). conclusions: despite a high prevalence of psychiatric disturbance, outcomes for patients transplanted emergently for acetaminophen-induced alf were comparable to those transplanted for non-acetaminophen-induced alf and electively for cld. multidisciplinary approaches with long-term psychiatric follow-up may contribute to low post-transplant suicide rates seen and low rates of graft loss because of non-compliance.";0;1;1;0

morphological features of encephalopathy after chronic administration of the antiepileptic drug valproate to rats. a transmission electron microscopic study of capillaries in the cerebellar cortex.;"long-term intragastric application of the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate (vupral ""polfa"") at the effective dose of 200 mg/kg b. w. once daily to rats for 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months revealed neurological disorders indicating cerebellum damage (""valproate encephalopathy""). the first ultrastructural changes in structural elements of the blood-brain-barrier (bbb) in the cerebellar cortex were detectable after 3 months of the experiment. they became more severe in the later months of the experiment, and were most severe after 12 months, located mainly in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. lesions of the capillary included necrosis of endothelial cells. organelles of these cells, in particular the mitochondria (increased number and size, distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae) and golgi apparatus were altered. reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had luminal protrusions and swollen microvilli. pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes. fragments of necrotic endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions. damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed. damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells, mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes. the proliferation of astrocytes (bergmann's in particular) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found. alterations in the structural elements of the bbb coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum (purkinje cells are earliest). in electron micrographs both luminal and antiluminal sides of the bbb of the cerebellar cortex had similar lesions. the possible influence of the hepatic damage, mainly hyperammonemia, upon the development of valproate encephalopathy is discussed.";0;1;1;0
nifedipine induced bradycardia in a patient with autonomic neuropathy.;an 80 year old diabetic male with evidence of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy was admitted with chest pain. he was found to have atrial flutter at a ventricular rate of 70/min which slowed down to 30-40/min when nifedipine (60 mg) in 3 divided doses, during which he was paced at a rate of 70/min. this is inconsistent with the well-established finding that nifedipine induces tachycardia in normally innervated hearts. however, in hearts deprived of compensatory sympathetic drive, it may lead to bradycardia.;1;0;1;0
ketanserin pretreatment reverses alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity.;systemic pretreatment with ketanserin, a relatively specific type-2 serotonin receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist alfentanil. following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, rigidity was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the alfentanil-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil. despite the absence of rigidity, animals that received ketanserin (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by alfentanil were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone. rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone. these results, in combination with previous work, suggest that muscle rigidity, a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways. pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced rigidity, although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced cns, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.;1;0;0;0

gt to at transition at a splice donor site causes skipping of the preceding exon in phenylketonuria.;classical phenylketonuria ( pku ) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) . we isolated several mutant pah cdna clones from a pku carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair deletion , corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal pah gene . the deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the c-terminal 52 amino acids . gene transfer and expression studies using the mutant pah cdna indicated that the deletion abolishes pah activity in the cell as a result of protein instability . to determine the molecular basis of the deletion , the mutant chromosomal pah gene was isolated from this individual and shown to contain a gt-- greater than at substitution at the 5 splice donor site of intron 12 . thus , the consequence of the splice donor site mutation in the human liver is the skipping of the preceding exon during rna splicing . .;0;1;0;0
characterization of a germline mosaicism in families with lowe syndrome, and identification of seven novel mutations in the ocrl1 gene.;the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of lowe ( ocrl ) is an x-linked disorder characterized by major abnormalities of eyes , nervous system , and kidneys . mutations in the ocrl1 gene have been associated with the disease . ocrl1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-biphosphate ( ptdins [ 4 , 5 ] p2 ) 5-phosphatase . we have examined the ocrl1 gene in eight unrelated patients with ocrl and have found seven new mutations and one recurrent in-frame deletion . among the new mutations , two nonsense mutations ( r317x and e558x ) and three other frameshift mutations caused premature termination of the protein . a missense mutation , r483g , was located in the highly conserved ptdins ( 4 , 5 ) p2 5-phosphatase domain . finally , one frameshift mutation , 2799delc , modifies the c-terminal part of ocrl1 , with an extension of six amino acids . altogether , 70 % of missense mutations are located in exon 15 , and 52 % of all mutations cluster in exons 11-15 . we also identified two new microsatellite markers for the ocrl1 locus , and we detected a germline mosaicism in one family . this observation has direct implications for genetic counseling of lowe syndrome families . .;0;1;0;0

the mouse homolog of the wiskott-aldrich syndrome protein (wasp) gene is highly conserved and maps near the scurfy (sf) mutation on the x chromosome.;the mouse wasp gene , the homolog of the gene mutated in wiskott-aldrich syndrome , has been isolated and sequenced . the predicted amino acid sequence is 86 % identical to the human wasp sequence . a distinct feature of the mouse gene is an expanded polymorphic gga trinucleotide repeat that codes for polyglycine and varies from 15 to 17 triplets in different mus musculus strains . the genomic structure of the mouse wasp gene is expressed as an approximately 2 . 4-kb mrna in thymus and spleen . chromosomal mapping in an interspecific m . musculus / m . spretus backcross placed the wasp locus near the centromere of the mouse x chromosome , inseparable from gata1 , tcfe3 , and scurfy ( sf ) . this localization makes wasp a candidate for involvement in scurfy , a t cell-mediated fatal lymphoreticular disease of mice that has previously been proposed as a mouse homolog of wiskott-aldrich syndrome . northern analysis of sf tissue samples indicated the presence of wasp mrna in liver and skin , presumably as a consequence of lymphocytic infiltration , but non abnormalities in the amount or size of mrna present .;0;1;0;0
butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged apnea after succinylcholine for electroconvulsive therapy.;background: patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ect) often receive succinylcholine as part of the anesthetic procedure. the duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (bche), the most common being the k- and the a-variants. the aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene (bche) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine after ect. methods: a total of 13 patients were referred to the danish cholinesterase research unit after ect during 38 months. we determined the bche activity and the bche genotype using molecular genetic methods, the duration of apnea, time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used. the duration of apnea was compared with published data on normal subjects. results: in 11 patients, mutations were found in the bche gene, the k-variant being the most frequent. the duration of apnea was 5-15 min compared with 3-5.3 min from the literature. severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients. neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients. conclusion: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in bche, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea. we recommend objective neuromuscular monitoring during the first ect.;0;0;1;0
deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with halothane, enflurane or isoflurane for middle-ear surgery.;the feasibility of using labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, as a hypotensive agent in combination with inhalation anaesthetics (halothane, enflurane or isoflurane) was studied in 23 adult patients undergoing middle-ear surgery. the mean arterial pressure was decreased from 86 +/- 5 (s.e. mean) mmhg to 52 +/- 1 mmhg (11.5 +/- 0.7 to 6.9 +/- 0.1 kpa) for 98 +/- 10 min in the halothane (h) group, from 79 +/- 5 to 53 +/- 1 mmhg (10.5 +/- 0.7 to 7.1 +/- 0.1 kpa) for 129 +/- 11 min in the enflurane (e) group, and from 80 +/- 4 to 49 +/- 1 mmhg (10.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 0.1 kpa) for 135 +/- 15 min in the isoflurane (i) group. the mean h concentration during hypotension in the inspiratory gas was 0.7 +/- 0.1 vol%, the mean e concentration 1.6 +/- 0.2 vol%, and the mean i concentration 1.0 +/- 0.1 vol%. in addition, the patients received fentanyl and d-tubocurarine. the initial dose of labetalol for lowering blood pressure was similar, 0.52-0.59 mg/kg, in all the groups. during hypotension, the heart rate was stable without tachy- or bradycardia. the operating conditions regarding bleeding were estimated in a double-blind manner, and did not differ significantly between the groups. during hypotension, the serum creatinine concentration rose significantly in all groups from the values before hypotension and returned postoperatively to the initial level in the other groups, except the isoflurane group. after hypotension there was no rebound phenomenon in either blood pressure or heart rate. these results indicate that labetalol induces easily adjustable hypotension without compensatory tachycardia and rebound hypertension.;1;1;0;0
mutation of the vhl gene is associated exclusively with the development of non-papillary renal cell carcinomas.;to define the possible role of the vhl gene in the development of sporadic renal cell carcinomas , 91 different parenchymal tumours of the kidney have been investigated for mutation of the vhl gene by single strand conformation polymorphism ( sscp ) and / or heteroduplex ( hd ) techniques . chromosome 3p deletion was detected in 98 per cent of non-papillary renal cell carcinomas and in 25 per cent of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas . in 22 of the 43 non-papillary renal cell carcinomas , abnormally migrating dna bands were detected by sscp and / or hd analysis . no mobility shift was seen in any of the 23 chromophobe renal cell carcinomas . in addition , 15 papillary renal cell tumours and ten renal oncocytomas , which are characterized by genetic changes other than loss of chromosome 3p sequences , were analysed for mutation of the vhl gene . none of these tumours showed abnormal migration patterns . the results indicate that mutation of the vhl gene is associated exclusively with the development of non-papillary renal cell carcinoma . .;0;1;0;1

down-regulation of norepinephrine transporter function induced by chronic administration of desipramine linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local-anesthetics-induced convulsions and the counteraction by co-administration with local anesthetics.;alterations of norepinephrine transporter (net) function by chronic inhibition of net in relation to sensitization to seizures induce by cocaine and local anesthetics were studied in mice. daily administration of desipramine, an inhibitor of the net, for 5 days decreased [(3)h]norepinephrine uptake in the p2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex, striatum or amygdalae. co-administration of lidocaine, bupivacaine or tricaine with desipramine reversed this effect. daily treatment of cocaine increased [(3)h]norepinephrine uptake into the hippocampus. daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine-induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine-induced convulsions. co-administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine. these results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal net induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions. inhibition of na(+) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine-induced down-regulation of net function. repeated administration of cocaine induces up-regulation of hippocampal net function. desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine seizures may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of cocaine.;0;0;1;0
dopamine d2 receptor signaling controls neuronal cell death induced by muscarinic and glutamatergic drugs.;dopamine (da), through d1/d2 receptor-mediated signaling, plays a major role in the control of epileptic seizures arising in the limbic system. excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level. in this respect, little is known about the role of da receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy-induced neuronal cell death. here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in d2r -/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine. we compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid (ka), a potent glutamate agonist. importantly, d2r -/- mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for wt littermates and show greater neurotoxicity. however, pilocarpine-induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both wt and d2r -/- brains in comparison to ka. thus, the absence of d2r lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine. moreover, the dopaminergic control of epilepsy-induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of d2r signaling with these two neurotransmitters.;0;0;1;0
catalepsy induced by combinations of ketamine and morphine: potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat.;"previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat. pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain. the present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, administered simultaneously. there was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, but sub-effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine. latency to the loss of righting reflex, rigidity and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination. naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects. the degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar. rats, tolerant to ketamine-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to morphine-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine. while the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy, differences in latency, rigidity and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different id50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site.";0;0;1;0
pelizaeus-merzbacher disease: an x-linked neurologic disorder of myelin metabolism with a novel mutation in the gene encoding proteolipid protein.;the nosology of the inborn errors of myelin metabolism has been stymied by the lack of molecular genetic analysis . historically , pelizaeus-merzbacher disease has encompassed a host of neurologic disorders that present with a deficit of myelin , the membrane elaborated by glial cells that encircles and successively enwraps axons . we describe here a pelizaeus-merzbacher pedigree of the classical type , with x-linked inheritance , a typical clinical progression , and a pathologic loss of myelinating cells and myelin in the central nervous system . to discriminate variants of pelizaeus-merzbacher disease , a set of oligonucleotide primers was constructed to polymerase-chain-reaction ( pcr ) amplify and sequence the gene encoding proteolipid protein ( plp ) , a structural protein that comprises half of the protein of the myelin sheath . the plp gene in one of two affected males and the carrier mother of this family exhibited a single base difference in the more than 2 kb of the plp gene sequenced , a c----t transition that would create a serine substitution for proline at the carboxy end of the protein . our results delineate the clinical features of pelizaeus-merzbacher disease , define the possible molecular pathology of this dysmyelinating disorder , and address the molecular classification of inborn errors of myelin metabolism . patients with the classical form ( type i ) and the more severely affected , connatal variant of pelizaeus-merzbacher disease ( type ii ) would be predicted to display mutation at the plp locus . the other variants ( types iii-vi ) , which have sometimes been categorized as pelizaeus-merzbacher disease , may represent mutations in genes encoding other structural myelin proteins or proteins critical to myelination . .;0;0;1;0

wilms' tumor 1 and dax-1 modulate the orphan nuclear receptor sf-1 in sex-specific gene expression.;products of steroidogenic factor 1 ( sf-1 ) and wilms tumor 1 ( wt1 ) genes are essential for mammalian gonadogenesis prior to sexual differentiation . in males , sf-1 participates in sexual development by regulating expression of the polypeptide hormone mullerian inhibiting substance ( mis ) . here , we show that wt1 -kts isoforms associate and synergize with sf-1 to promote mis expression . in contrast , wt1 missense mutations , associated with male pseudohermaphroditism in denys-drash syndrome , fail to synergize with sf-1 . additionally , the x-linked , candidate dosage-sensitive sex-reversal gene , dax-1 , antagonizes synergy between sf-1 and wt1 , most likely through a direct interaction with sf-1 . we propose that wt1 and dax-1 functionally oppose each other in testis development by modulating sf-1-mediated transactivation . .;0;0;1;1

gaucher disease: the origins of the ashkenazi jewish n370s and 84gg acid beta-glucosidase mutations.;type 1 gaucher disease ( gd ) , a non-neuronopathic lysosomal storage disorder , results from the deficient activity of acid beta-glucosidase ( gba ) . type 1 disease is panethnic but is more prevalent in individuals of ashkenazi jewish ( aj ) descent . of the causative gba mutations , n370s is particularly frequent in the aj population , ( q approximately . 03 ) , whereas the 84gg insertion ( q approximately . 003 ) occurs exclusively in the ashkenazim . to investigate the genetic history of these mutations in the aj population , short tandem repeat ( str ) markers were used to map a 9 . 3-cm region containing the gba locus and to genotype 261 aj n370s chromosomes , 60 european non-jewish n370s chromosomes , and 62 aj 84gg chromosomes . a highly conserved haplotype at four markers flanking gba ( pklr , d1s1595 , d1s2721 , and d1s2777 ) was observed on both the aj chromosomes and the non-jewish n370s chromosomes , suggesting the occurrence of a founder common to both populations . of note , the presence of different divergent haplotypes suggested the occurrence of de novo , recurrent n370s mutations . in contrast , a different conserved haplotype at these markers was identified on the 84gg chromosomes , which was unique to the aj population . on the basis of the linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) delta values , the non-jewish european n370s chromosomes had greater haplotype diversity and less ld at the markers flanking the conserved haplotype than did the aj n370s chromosomes . this finding is consistent with the presence of the n370s mutation in the non-jewish european population prior to the founding of the aj population . coalescence analyses for the n370s and 84gg mutations estimated similar coalescence times , of 48 and 55.5 generations ago , respectively . the results of these studies are consistent with a significant bottleneck occurring in the aj population during the first millennium , when the population became established in europe .;0;0;1;0

amiodarone and the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation and prior myocardial infarction.;objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether the use of amiodarone in patients with atrial fibrillation (af) increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker. background: reports of severe bradyarrhythmia during amiodarone therapy are infrequent and limited to studies assessing the therapy's use in the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias. methods: a study cohort of 8,770 patients age > or =65 years with a new diagnosis of af was identified from a provincewide database of quebec residents with a myocardial infarction (mi) between 1991 and 1999. using a nested case-control design, 477 cases of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker were matched (1:4) to 1,908 controls. multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (or) of pacemaker insertion associated with amiodarone use, controlling for baseline risk factors and exposure to sotalol, class i antiarrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. results: amiodarone use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (or: 2.14, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.30 to 3.54). this effect was modified by gender, with a greater risk in women versus men (or: 3.86, 95% ci: 1.70 to 8.75 vs. or: 1.52, 95% ci: 0.80 to 2.89). digoxin was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (or: 1.78, 95% ci: 1.37 to 2.31). conclusions: this study suggests that the use of amiodarone in elderly patients with af and a previous mi increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker. the finding of an augmented risk of pacemaker insertion in elderly women receiving amiodarone requires further investigation.;1;0;0;0

risks and benefits of cox-2 inhibitors vs non-selective nsaids: does their cardiovascular risk exceed their gastrointestinal benefit? a retrospective cohort study.;objectives: the risk of acute myocardial infarction (ami) with cox-2 inhibitors may offset their gastrointestinal (gi) benefit compared with non-selective (ns) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). we aimed to compare the risks of hospitalization for ami and gi bleeding among elderly patients using cox-2 inhibitors, ns-nsaids and acetaminophen. methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients > or =65 years of age who filled a prescription for nsaid or acetaminophen during 1999-2002. outcomes were compared using cox regression models with time-dependent exposures. results: person-years of exposure among non-users of aspirin were: 75,761 to acetaminophen, 42,671 to rofecoxib 65,860 to celecoxib, and 37,495 to ns-nsaids. among users of aspirin, they were: 14,671 to rofecoxib, 22,875 to celecoxib, 9,832 to ns-nsaids and 38,048 to acetaminophen. among non-users of aspirin, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of hospitalization for ami/gi vs the acetaminophen (with no aspirin) group were: rofecoxib 1.27 (1.13, 1.42), celecoxib 0.93 (0.83, 1.03), naproxen 1.59 (1.31, 1.93), diclofenac 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and ibuprofen 1.05 (0.74, 1.51). among users of aspirin, they were: rofecoxib 1.73 (1.52, 1.98), celecoxib 1.34 (1.19, 1.52), ibuprofen 1.51 (0.95, 2.41), diclofenac 1.69 (1.35, 2.10), naproxen 1.35 (0.97, 1.88) and acetaminophen 1.29 (1.17, 1.42). conclusion: among non-users of aspirin, naproxen seemed to carry the highest risk for ami/gi bleeding. the ami/gi toxicity of celecoxib was similar to that of acetaminophen and seemed to be better than those of rofecoxib and ns-nsaids. among users of aspirin, both celecoxib and naproxen seemed to be the least toxic.;1;0;0;0

structure-activity and dose-effect relationships of the antagonism of picrotoxin-induced seizures by cholecystokinin, fragments and analogues of cholecystokinin in mice.;intraperitoneal administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate ester (cck-8-se) and nonsulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (cck-8-ns) enhanced the latency of seizures induced by picrotoxin in mice. experiments with n- and c-terminal fragments revealed that the c-terminal tetrapeptide (cck-5-8) was the active centre of the cck octapeptide molecule. the analogues cck-8-se and cck-8-ns (dose range 0.2-6.4 mumol/kg) and caerulein dose range 0.1-0.8 mumol/kg) showed bell-shaped dose-effect curves, with the greatest maximum inhibition for cck-8-ns. the peptide cck-5-8 had weak anticonvulsant activity in comparison to the octapeptides, 3.2 mumol/kg and larger doses of the reference drug, diazepam, totally prevented picrotoxin-induced seizures and mortality. the maximum effect of the peptides tested was less than that of diazepam. experiments with analogues and derivatives of cck-5-8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the beta-alanyl derivatives of cck-5-8 were enhanced and that they were equipotent with cck-8-se. of the cck-2-8 analogues, ser(so3h)7-ac-cck-2-8-se and thr(so3h)7-ac-cck-2-8-se and hyp(so3h)-ac-cck-2-8-se were slightly more active than cck-8-se.;0;0;1;0

effect of nondopaminergic drugs on l-dopa-induced dyskinesias in mptp-treated monkeys.;a group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin mptp. they were then treated chronically with l-dopa/benserazide 50/12.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 2 months. this dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect, but all animals manifested dyskinesia. a series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with l-dopa to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified. several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-mdot, propranolol, and mk-801, markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology. however, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements. baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia. atropine converted the dystonic movements into chorea.;0;0;1;0

a dramatic drop in blood pressure following prehospital gtn administration.;a male in his sixties with no history of cardiac chest pain awoke with chest pain following an afternoon sleep. the patient did not self medicate. the patient's observations were within normal limits, he was administered oxygen via a face mask and glyceryl trinitrate (gtn). several minutes after the gtn the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate, this was rectified by atropine sulphate and a fluid challenge. there was no further deterioration in the patient's condition during transport to hospital. there are very few documented case like this in the prehospital scientific literature. the cause appears to be the bezold-jarish reflex, stimulation of the ventricular walls which in turn decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre. prehospital care providers who are managing any patient with a syncopal episode that fails to recover within a reasonable time frame should consider the bezold-jarisch reflex as the cause and manage the patient accordingly.;1;0;0;0

endocrine screening in 1,022 men with erectile dysfunction: clinical significance and cost-effective strategy.;purpose: we reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities. materials and methods: testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay. every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire, gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml. determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results. prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination. main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire, small testes and gynecomastia. endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. results: testosterone was less than 3 ng./ml. in 107 patients but normal in 40% at repeat determination. the prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age (4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older). two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination. most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%). determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low testosterone, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. prolactin exceeded 20 ng./ml. in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination. only 1 prolactinoma was discovered. these data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades (overall prolactin greater than 20 ng./ml. in 1.86% of 1,821 patients, prolactinomas in 7, 0.38%). bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. (8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng./ml.). testosterone was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. conclusions: low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination. however, cost-effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors. we now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years. prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire, gynecomastia and/or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml.;0;0;0;1

chronic carbamazepine inhibits the development of local anesthetic seizures kindled by cocaine and lidocaine.;the effects of carbamazepine (cbz) treatment on local anesthetic-kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of cbz administration. chronic oral cbz inhibited the development of both lidocaine- and cocaine-induced seizures, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures. chronic cbz also decreased the incidence of seizure-related mortality in the cocaine-injected rats. acute cbz over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine-kindled or acute cocaine-induced seizures. repeated i.p. injection of cbz (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine- or cocaine-kindled seizures. the differential effects of cbz depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled seizures. the effectiveness of chronic but not repeated, intermittent injections of cbz suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens. the possible utility of chronic cbz in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data, but remains to be directly evaluated.;0;0;1;0

source of pain and primitive dysfunction in migraine: an identical site?;twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin (10 patients) or placebo ointment (10 patients) in a double blind study. early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group. subsequently 20 migraine patients, who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin, received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas. no early onset migraine was observed. thus the migraine-inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain, suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine crisis. this is not consistent with a cns origin of migraine attack.;0;0;1;0

predictors of decreased renal function in patients with heart failure during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy: results from the studies of left ventricular dysfunction (solvd);"background: although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure (chf), it may also cause decreased renal function. little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication. objective: to quantify specific clinical predictors of reduction in renal function in patients with chf who are prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. method: we analyzed data from the studies of left ventricular dysfunction (solvd), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of chf. there were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >/=0.5 mg/dl (44 micromol/l) from baseline. we used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, diuretic, and beta-blocker therapy. results: patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls (p =.003). by multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [rr] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: rr 1.18, 95% ci 1.12-1.25). diuretic therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of decreased renal function in the enalapril group (rr 1.89, 95% ci 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (rr 1.35, 95% ci 1.09-1.66). conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (rr 1.33, 95% ci 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (rr 1.96, 95% ci 1.57-2.44) in patients with diabetes. a lower risk of renal impairment was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (rr 0.70, 95% ci 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (rr 0.93 per 5% increment, 95% ci 0.91-0. 96). conclusions: enalapril use caused a 33% increase in the risk of decreased renal function in patients with chf. diuretic use and advanced age increased this risk. diabetes was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment in all patients with chf, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group. beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of therapy.";1;1;0;0

effects of training on the extent of experimental myocardial infarction in aging rats.;the effects of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction were studied in female albino rats of 20,40,60 and 80 weeks of age. the rats were trained to swim for a specific duration and for a particular period. the occurrence of infarcts were confirmed by histological methods. elevations in the serum got and gpt were maximum in the sedentary-isoproterenols and minimum in the exercise-controls. these changes in the serum transaminases were associated with corresponding depletions in the cardiac got and gpt. however, age was seen to interfere with the responses exhibited by the young and old rats. studies dealing with myocardial infarction are more informative when dealt with age.;1;1;0;0

determination of 30 x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy mutations, including 15 not previously described.;x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( x-ald ) is the most frequent peroxisomal disease . it mainly involves the nervous system white matter , adrenal cortex and testes . several distinct clinical phenotypes are known . the principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids ( vlcfas  > c22  0 , mainly c26  0 ) , which is due to impaired capacity for beta-oxidation in peroxisomes . diagnosis is usually based on the vlcfa levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers . in 0 . 1 % of affected males , however , the plasma c26  0 level is borderline normal , and 15 % of obligate female carriers have normal results . effective mutation detection in these families is therefore fundamental to unambiguously determine the genetic status of each individual at risk . of particular concern are female members of kindreds segregating x-ald mutations , because normal vlcfa levels do not guarantee lack of carrier status . we describe a fast method for detection of x-ald mutations . the method is based on sscp analysis of nested pcr fragments followed by sequence-determination reactions . using this methodology we have found x-ald mutations in 30 kindreds , including 15 not previously reported .;0;1;1;0
anti-epileptic drugs-induced de novo absence seizures.;the authors present three patients with de novo absence epilepsy after administration of carbamazepine and vigabatrin. despite the underlying diseases, the prognosis for drug-induced de novo absence seizure is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs. the gamma-aminobutyric acid-transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the absence epilepsy. because drug-induced de novo absence seizure is rare, pro-absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor. the underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo absence seizure. the possibility of drug-induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in seizure frequency and/or new seizure types appear following a change in drug treatment. by understanding the underlying mechanism of absence epilepsy, we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with epilepsy and prevent drug-induced absence seizures.;0;0;1;0

longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase iii clinical trial of difluoromethylornithine and sulindac for prevention of sporadic colorectal adenomas.;"a phase iii clinical trial assessed the recurrence of adenomatous polyps after treatment for 36 months with difluoromethylornithine (dfmo) plus sulindac or matched placebos. temporary hearing loss is a known toxicity of treatment with dfmo, thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms. the generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within-subject correlation due to repeated measurements at frequencies. based on 290 subjects, there was an average difference of 0.50 db between subjects treated with dfmo plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo (95% confidence interval, -0.64 to 1.63 db; p = 0.39), adjusted for baseline values, age, and frequencies. in the normal speech range of 500 to 3,000 hz, an estimated difference of 0.99 db (-0.17 to 2.14 db; p = 0.09) was detected. dose intensity did not add information to models. there were 14 of 151 (9.3%) in the dfmo plus sulindac group and 4 of 139 (2.9%) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 db hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested (p = 0.02). follow-up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1.08 db (-0.81 to 2.96 db; p = 0.26) between treatment arms. there was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the dfmo plus sulindac group who experienced clinically significant hearing loss compared with the placebo group. the estimated attributable risk of ototoxicity from exposure to the drug is 8.4% (95% confidence interval, -2.0% to 18.8%; p = 0.12). there is a <2 db difference in mean threshold for patients treated with dfmo plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo.";0;0;1;0
management strategies for ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia in the treatment of hepatitis c: clinical and economic implications.;objectives: recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha-2b/ribavirin compared with interferon-alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c (chc). combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia (riha). the objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of riha during treatment of chc in a clinical trial setting. methods: a systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of riha. decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating riha. uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses. results: riha, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g/l, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy. the standard of care for management of riha is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage. we estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant riha to be  170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range  68- 692). the results of the one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from  57 to  317. in comparison, the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is  16,459. conclusions: the direct cost of treating clinically significant riha is 1% ( 170/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs. questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of riha in a real-world population. despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating riha provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect.;0;1;0;0

topotecan in combination with radiotherapy in unresectable glioblastoma: a phase 2 study.;improving glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) treatment with radio-chemotherapy remains a challenge. topotecan is an attractive option as it exhibits growth inhibition of human glioma as well as brain penetration. the present study assessed the combination of radiotherapy (60 gy/30 fractions/40 days) and topotecan (0.9 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 on weeks 1, 3 and 5) in 50 adults with histologically proven and untreated gbm. the incidence of non-hematological toxicities was low and grade 3-4 hematological toxicities were reported in 20 patients (mainly lymphopenia and neutropenia). partial response and stabilization rates were 2% and 32%, respectively, with an overall time to progression of 12 weeks. one-year overall survival (os) rate was 42%, with a median os of 40 weeks. topotecan in combination with radiotherapy was well tolerated. however, while response and stabilization concerned one-third of the patients, the study did not show increased benefits in terms of survival in patients with unresectable gbm.;0;0;1;0
myotonic dystrophy in transgenic mice expressing an expanded cug repeat.;myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) , the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adult humans , results from expansion of a ctg repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the dmpk gene . the mutant dmpk messenger rna ( mrna ) contains an expanded cug repeat and is retained in the nucleus . we have expressed an untranslated cug repeat in an unrelated mrna in transgenic mice . mice that expressed expanded cug repeats developed myotonia and myopathy , whereas mice expressing a nonexpanded repeat did not . thus , transcripts with expanded cug repeats are sufficient to generate a dm phenotype . this result supports a role for rna gain of function in disease pathogenesis . .;0;0;1;0

sex differences in nmda antagonist enhancement of morphine antihyperalgesia in a capsaicin model of persistent pain: comparisons to two models of acute pain.;in acute pain models, n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of morphine to a greater extent in males than females. the purpose of this investigation was to extend these findings to a persistent pain model which could be distinguished from acute pain models on the basis of the nociceptive fibers activated, neurochemical substrates, and duration of the nociceptive stimulus. to this end, persistent hyperalgesia was induced by administration of capsaicin in the tail of gonadally intact f344 rats, following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus, and tail-withdrawal latencies measured. for comparison, tests were conducted in two acute pain models, the hotplate and warm water tail-withdrawal procedures. in males, the non-competitive nmda antagonist dextromethorphan enhanced the antihyperalgesic effect of low to moderate doses of morphine in a dose-and time-dependent manner. across the doses and pretreatment times examined, enhancement was not observed in females. enhancement of morphine antinociception by dextromethorphan was seen in both males and females in the acute pain models, with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males. these findings demonstrate a sexually-dimorphic interaction between nmda antagonists and morphine in a persistent pain model that can be distinguished from those observed in acute pain models.;0;0;1;0
reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus in a pediatric heart transplant recipient: case report.;"tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. however, adverse effects include cardiac toxicity. herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation. the hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. the blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy. thus, we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy. in patients receiving tacrolimus therapy, blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement.";1;0;1;0
mutations associated with lamivudine-resistance in therapy-na  ve hepatitis b virus (hbv) infected patients with and without hiv co-infection: implications for antiretroviral therapy in hbv and hiv co-infected south african patients.;this was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine-resistant hepatitis b virus (hbv) strains in selected lamivudine-na  ve hbv carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) co-infection in south african patients. thirty-five lamivudine-na  ve hbv infected patients with or without hiv co-infection were studied: 15 chronic hbv mono-infected patients and 20 hbv-hiv co-infected patients. the latter group was further sub-divided into 13 occult hbv (hbsag-negative) and 7 overt hbv (hbsag- positive) patients. hbsag, anti-hbs, anti-hbc, and anti-hiv 1/2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using axsym assays (abbott laboratories, north chicago, il). serum samples were pcr amplified with hbv reverse transcriptase (rt) primers, followed by direct sequencing across the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (ymdd) motif of the major catalytic region in the c domain of the hbv rt enzyme. hbv viral load was performed with amplicor hbv monitor test v2.0 (roche diagnostics, penzberg, germany). hbv lamivudine-resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic hepatitis b patients and 10 of 20 hbv-hiv co-infected patients. to the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of hbv lamivudine-resistant strains in therapy-na  ve hbv-hiv co-infected patients. the hbv viral loads for mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively. it remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of hbv resistant strains when lamivudine-containing highly active antiretroviral (arv) treatment (haart) regimens become widely applied in south africa, as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of hbv-hiv co-infected patients.;0;1;0;0
myotonic dystrophy: evidence for a possible dominant-negative rna mutation.;"the trinucleotide expansion mutation causing myotonic dystrophy is in the 3 untranslated region of a protein kinase gene . the molecular mechanisms by which the expanded repeat causes the clinically variable and multisystemic disease , myotonic dystrophy , are not understood . it has been particularly difficult to rationalize the dominant inheritance with the fact that the expansion mutation lies outside of the protein-encoding gene elements , and should not be translated into protein . here we use muscle biopsies from classical adult-onset myotonic dystrophy patients to study the accumulation of transcripts from both the normal and expanded dm kinase genes in patient muscle , and compare the results to normal and myopathic controls . we found relatively small decreases of dm kinase rna in the total rna pool from muscle ; however , these reductions were not disease specific . analysis of poly ( a ) + rna showed dramatic decreases of both the mutant and normal dm kinase rnas , and these changes were disease-specific . our findings are consistent with a novel molecular pathogenetic mechanism for myotonic dystrophy  both the normal and expanded dm kinase genes are transcribed in patient muscle , but the abnormal expansion-containing rna has a dominant effect on rna metabolism by preventing the accumulation of poly ( a ) + rna . the ability of the expansion mutation to alter accumulation of poly ( a ) + rna in trans suggests that myotonic dystrophy may be the first example of a dominant-negative mutation manifested at the rna level . .";0;0;1;0
estradiol reduces seizure-induced hippocampal injury in ovariectomized female but not in male rats.;estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from hippocampal injury induced by kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (se). we compared the effects of 17beta-estradiol in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to lithium-pilocarpine-induced se. rats received subcutaneous injections of 17beta-estradiol (2 microg/rat) or oil once daily for four consecutive days. se was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later. the extent of silver-stained ca3 and ca1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after se. 17beta-estradiol did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males. 17beta-estradiol reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the ca1 and ca3-c sectors of ovariectomized rats. in males, estradiol increased the total damage score. these findings suggest that the effects of estradiol on seizure threshold and damage may be altered by sex-related differences in the hormonal environment.;0;0;1;0
mutations in the arginine-rich protein gene (arp) in pancreatic cancer.;the arp gene encodes a highly conserved arginine-rich protein from chromosomal band 3p21 . 1 1 . at the cytogenetic level this region is frequently deleted in a variety of different solid tumors , although not in pancreatic cancer . we have reported the presence of a specific mutation ( atg50-- > agg ) or deletion of codon 50 of the arp gene in different tumor types ( shridhar et al . , 1996 , 1996a ) . in the present study , we have observed mutations involving codon 50 in 11 of 37 pancreatic tumors . the frequency of codon 50 mutation is roughly the same in pancreatic tumors as in the other types of tumors previously examined . in addition , we have detected mutations at codon 51 in multiple pcr subclones in two other pancreatic tumors . mutations in the arp gene are thus commonly observed in pancreatic cancer , as well as many other cancers .;0;0;0;1
fatal aplastic anemia due to indomethacin--lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro.;although indomethacin has been implicated as a possible cause of aplastic anemia on the basis of a few clinical observations, its role has not been definitely established. a case of fatal aplastic anemia is described in which no drugs other than allopurinol and indomethacin were given. indomethacin was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. a positive lymphocyte transformation test with indomethacin in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing aplastic anemia in a susceptible patient. fortunately, this seems to be a very rare complication.;0;0;1;0
germline e-cadherin gene (cdh1) mutations predispose to familial gastric cancer and colorectal cancer .;"inherited mutations in the e-cadherin gene ( cdh1 ) were described recently in three maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer . familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non-maori populations is due to germline cdh1 mutations . therefore , we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of british and irish origin for germline cdh1 mutations , by sscp analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences . each family contained  ( i ) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years ; or ( ii ) three or more cases of gastric cancer . novel germline cdh1 mutations ( a nonsense and a splice site ) were detected in two families ( 25 % ) . both mutations were predicted to truncate the e-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain . in one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer ; thus , in addition to six cases of gastric cancer , a cdh1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years . we have confirmed that germline mutations in the cdh1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-maori populations . however , only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by cdh1 mutations . loss of e-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers , and our findings provide evidence that germline cdh1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer . thus , cdh1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers .";0;0;0;1
hepatotoxicity of amiodarone.;amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias. the use of amiodarone has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. a patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given. it is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels. therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly.;1;1;0;0

lethal anuria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy in a breast cancer patient with an impaired renal function.;a sixty-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer, previously treated with cisplatin, developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with anuria, the day after 5 g/m2 bolus ifosfamide. postrenal failure was excluded by echography. a prerenal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension, due to an increasing ascitis, occurring just before anuria. however, correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function. ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies. we strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide, occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypotension. we recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion.;0;1;0;1

pallidotomy with the gamma knife: a positive experience.;51 patients with medically refractory parkinson's disease underwent stereotactic posteromedial pallidotomy between august 1993 and february 1997 for treatment of bradykinesia, rigidity, and l-dopa-induced dyskinesias. in 29 patients, the pallidotomies were performed with the leksell gamma knife and in 22 they were performed with the standard radiofrequency (rf) method. clinical assessment as well as blinded ratings of unified parkinson's disease rating scale (updrs) scores were carried out pre- and postoperatively. mean follow-up time is 20.6 months (range 6-48) and all except 4 patients have been followed more than one year. 85 percent of patients with dyskinesias were relieved of symptoms, regardless of whether the pallidotomies were performed with the gamma knife or radiofrequency methods. about 2/3 of the patients in both gamma knife and radiofrequency groups showed improvements in bradykinesia and rigidity, although when considered as a group neither the gamma knife nor the radiofrequency group showed statistically significant improvements in updrs scores. one patient in the gamma knife group (3.4%) developed a homonymous hemianopsia 9 months following treatment and 5 patients (27.7%) in the radiofrequency group became transiently confused postoperatively. no other complications were seen. gamma knife pallidotomy is as effective as radiofrequency pallidotomy in controlling certain of the symptoms of parkinson's disease. it may be the only practical technique available in certain patients, such as those who take anticoagulants, have bleeding diatheses or serious systemic medical illnesses. it is a viable option for other patients as well.;0;0;1;0

fluoxetine-induced akathisia: clinical and theoretical implications.;"five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia. the typical fluoxetine-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine-induced akathisia were identical, although somewhat milder. akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, dose reduction, or both. the authors suggest that fluoxetine-induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine-induced akathisia and tricyclic antidepressant-induced ""jitteriness"" may be identical.";0;0;1;0

nonalcoholic fatty liver disease during valproate therapy.;"valproic acid (vpa) is effective for the treatment of many types of epilepsy, but its use can be associated with an increase in body weight. we report a case of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) arising in a child who developed obesity during vpa treatment. laboratory data revealed hyperinsulinemia with insulin resistance. after the withdrawal of vpa therapy, our patient showed a significant weight loss, a decrease of body mass index, and normalization of metabolic and endocrine parameters; moreover, ultrasound measurements showed a complete normalization. the present case suggests that obesity, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and long-term treatment with vpa may be all associated with the development of nafld; this side effect is reversible after vpa withdrawal.";0;1;1;0
force overflow and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in parkinson's disease.;we assessed force coordination of the hand in parkinson's disease and its relationship to motor complications of levodopa therapy, particularly to levodopa-induced dyskinesias (lid). we studied two groups of parkinson's disease patients with (parkinson's disease + lid, n = 23) and without levodopa-induced dyskinesias (parkinson's disease - lid, n = 10), and age-matched healthy controls. the motor score of the unified parkinson's disease rating scale, a dyskinesia score and force in a grip-lift paradigm were assessed on and off levodopa. a pathological increase of forces was seen in on-state in parkinson's disease + lid only. in parkinson's disease + lid, the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa (by 61%, p < 0.05). an overshooting of peak grip force by 51% (p < 0.05) and of static grip force by 45% (p < 0.01) was observed in the on- compared with the off-drug condition. in contrast, no excessive force was found in parkinson's disease - lid. peak grip force in on-state was 140% (p < 0.05) higher in parkinson's disease + lid than in parkinson's disease - lid, while static grip force was increased by 138% (p < 0.01) between groups. severity of peak-dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in on-state (r = 0.79 with peak force, p < 0.01). no correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication. force excess was only observed in patients with lid and motor fluctuations. a close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and dyskinesias in the on-drug condition. we postulate that both lid and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations.;0;0;1;0

x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a frequent cause of idiopathic addison's disease in young adult male patients.;x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) is a genetic disease associated with demyelination of the central nervous system , adrenal insufficiency , and accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissue and body fluids . ald is due to mutation of a gene located in xq28 that encodes a peroxisomal transporter protein of unknown function . the most common phenotype of ald is the cerebral form ( 45 % ) that develops in boys between 5-12 yr . adrenomyeloneuropathy ( amn ) involves the spinal cord and peripheral nerves in young adults ( 35 % ) . adrenal insufficiency ( addisons disease ) is frequently associated with amn or cerebral ald and may remain the only clinical expression of ald ( 8 % of cases ) . the prevalence of ald among adults with addisons disease remains unknown . to evaluate this prevalence , we performed biochemical analysis of very long chain fatty acids in 14 male patients ( age ranging from 12-45 yr at diagnosis ) previously diagnosed as having primary idiopathic adrenocortical insufficiency . in 5 of 14 patients ( 35 % ) , elevated plasma concentrations of very long chain fatty acids were detected . none of these patients had adrenocortical antibodies . by electrophysiological tests and magnetic resonance imaging it was determined that two patients had cerebral ald , one had adrenomyeloneuropathy with cerebral involvement , and two had preclinical amn . our data support the hypothesis that ald is a frequent cause of idiopathic addisons disease in children and adults . .;0;1;1;0

acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial dyskinesia in rats.;reserpine- and haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia (td) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress. in the present study, the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats. reserpine injection (one dose of 1 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control. haloperidol administration (one dose of 12 mg/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations. after the treatments and behavioral observation, glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed. a decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol, compared to the control. importantly, a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia. these results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats.;0;0;1;0

effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical epileptic discharges in penicillin - induced epilepsy model in rats.;aim: experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal dbs can control epileptic activity, but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined. the aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin-induced epilepsy model. material and methods: twenty-five sprague-dawley rats were implanted dbs electrodes. in group-1 (n=10) hippocampal dbs was off and in the group-2 (n=10) hippocampal dbs was on (185 hz, 0.5v, 1v, 2v, and 5v for 60 sec) following penicillin g injection intracortically. in the control group hippocampal dbs was on following 8  l saline injection intracortically. eeg recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin-g injection, and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency, amplitude, and power spectrum. results: high frequency hippocampal dbs suppressed the acute penicillin-induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity. in the control group, hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5v stimulation. conclusion: our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges. these results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal dbs in patients with epilepsy.;0;0;1;0

physical training decreases susceptibility to subsequent pilocarpine-induced seizures in the rat.;regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for epilepsy are still controversial. in order to elucidate this problem, we have studied the effect of long-term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent seizures. male wistar rats were subjected to repeated training sessions in a treadmill and swimming pool. thereafter, seizures were induced by pilocarpine injections in trained and non-trained control groups. during the acute period of status epilepticus, we measured: (1) the latency of the first motor sign, (2) the intensity of seizures, (3) the time when it occurred within the 6-h observation period, and (4) the time when the acute period ended. all these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced seizures and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced status epilepticus.;0;0;1;0
in vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths during acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone-induced lung toxicity and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by a novel ih636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract.;"grape seed extract, primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins, has been shown to modulate a wide-range of biological, pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective. this study assessed the ability of ih636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (gspe) to prevent acetaminophen (aap)-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone (ami)-induced lung toxicity, and doxorubicin (dox)-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. experimental design consisted of four groups: control (vehicle alone), gspe alone, drug alone and gspe+drug. for the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg/kg gspe for 7-10 days followed by i.p. injections of organ specific three drugs (aap: 500 mg/kg for 24 h; ami: 50 mg/kg/day for four days; dox: 20 mg/kg for 48 h). parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry (alt, bun and cpk), and orderly fragmentation of genomic dna (both endonuclease-dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and/or protection in corresponding pas stained tissues. results indicate that gspe preexposure prior to aap, ami and dox, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes (alt, bun and cpk), and significantly reduced dna fragmentation. histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of gspe preexposure than in its presence. gspe+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery. additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of dna fragmentation. interestingly, all the drugs, such as, aap, ami and dox induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by gspe. since aap, ami and dox undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by gspe may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals. in addition, its' presumed contribution to dna repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process. additionally, this may have been the first report on ami-induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue. taken together, these events undoubtedly establish gspe's abundant bioavailability, and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo.";1;1;1;0

ventricular tachyarrhythmias during cesarean section after ritodrine therapy: interaction with anesthetics.;this case illustrates that patients receiving ritodrine for preterm labor may risk interactions between the residual betamimetic effects of ritodrine and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean section. such interactions may result in serious cardiovascular complications even after cessation of an infusion of ritodrine. preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum potassium level. delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possible. careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of ephedrine are advised. after delivery of the infant, there should be no contraindication to the use of an alpha-adrenergic vasopressor such as phenylephrine to treat hypotensive patients with tachycardia.;1;1;0;0

cardiovascular effects of hypotension induced by adenosine triphosphate and sodium nitroprusside on dogs with denervated hearts.;"adenosine triphosphate (atp) and sodium nitroprusside (snp) are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesia. snp is authorized for clinical use in usa and uk, and atp is clinically used in other countries such as japan. we investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had devised. atp (10 dogs) or snp (10 dogs) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30% to 70% of control. before, during and after induced hypotension, we measured major cardiovascular parameters. hypotension induced by atp was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.001), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.001), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), total body oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), and heart rate (p less than 0.001); all these variables returned normal within 30 min after atp was stopped. cardiac output did not change. during hypotension produced by snp similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood (p less than 0.05), while heart rate (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.05) were increased. recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after snp had been stopped. both atp and snp should act on the pacemaker tissue of the heart.";1;0;1;0
hypercalcemia, arrhythmia, and mood stabilizers.;"recent findings in a bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy who developed hypercalcemia and severe bradyarrhythmia prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study of bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia. a printout of all cases of hypercalcemia that presented during a 1-year period was generated. after eliminating spurious hypercalcemias or those associated with intravenous fluids, the authors identified 18 non-lithium-treated patients with hypercalcemias related to malignancies and other medical conditions (group a) and 12 patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia (group b). patients in group b were not comparable to those in group a, as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies. thus, two control groups were generated: group c1, which included age- and sex-comparable lithium-treated bipolar normocalcemic patients, and group c2, which included bipolar normocalcemic patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers. the electrocardiographic (ecg) findings for patients in group b were compared with those of patients in groups c1 and c2. it was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ecg abnormalities; however, there were significant differences in the frequency of conduction defects. patients with hypercalcemia resulting from medical diseases and bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia had significantly higher frequencies of conduction defects. patients in group a had significant mortality at 2-year follow-up (28%), in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups. the clinical implications of these findings are discussed.";1;0;0;0

mefenamic acid-induced neutropenia and renal failure in elderly females with hypothyroidism.;we report mefenamic acid-induced non-oliguric renal failure and severe neutropenia occurring simultaneously in two elderly females. the neutropenia was due to maturation arrest of the myeloid series in one patient. both patients were also hypothyroid, but it is not clear whether this was a predisposing factor to the development of these adverse reactions. however, it would seem prudent not to use mefenamic acid in hypothyroid patients until the hypothyroidism has been corrected.;0;1;0;0
severe congestive heart failure patient on amiodarone presenting with myxedemic coma: a case report.;this is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure (chf). to our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy. myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment. the condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine (t4) or intravenous tri-iodo-thyronine (t3). patients with chf on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) levels. this case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among chf patients. the myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among chf patients presenting with hypotension, weakness or other unexplained symptoms.;1;0;1;0

effects of ouabain on myocardial oxygen supply and demand in patients with chronic coronary artery disease. a hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic study in patients without heart failure.;the effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease, but have not been measured previously in man. we assessed the effects of ouabain (0.015 mg/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure. because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations, we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted. left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients. left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 11.5+/-1.4 (mean+/-se) to 5.6+/-0.9 mm hg (p less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell from 100+/-17 to 82+/-12 ml/m2 (p less than 0.01) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed. the maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1.68+/-0.11 ml/s to 2.18+/-0.21 muscle-lengths/s (p less than 0.05) and is consistent with an increase in contractility. no significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients. no significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients. we conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end-diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal. though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial oxygen consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. nevertheless, compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism.;1;0;1;0

medial changes in arterial spasm induced by l-norepinephrine.;in normal rats, the media of small arteries (0.4--0.2 mm in diameter) previously was shown to contain intracellular vacuoles, identified ultrastructurally as herniations of one smooth muscle cell into another. the hypothesis that intense vasoconstriction would increase the number of such vacuoles has been tested. in the media of the saphenous artery and its distal branch, vasoconstriction induced by l-norepinephrine produced many cell-to-cell hernias within 15 minutes. at 1 day their number was reduced to about 1/10 of the original number. by 7 days the vessel was almost restored to normal. triple stimulation over 1 day induced more severe changes in the media. these findings suggest that smooth muscle cells are susceptible to damage in the course of their specific function. the experimental data are discussed in relation to medial changes observed in other instances of arterial spasm. endothelial changes that developed in the same experimental model were described in a previous paper.;1;0;0;0

atm and p53 cooperate in apoptosis and suppression of tumorigenesis, but not in resistance to acute radiation toxicity.;mutations in atm and p53 cause the human cancer-associated diseases ataxia-telangiectasia and li-fraumeni syndrome , respectively . the two genes are believed to interact in a number of pathways , including regulation of dna damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints , apoptosis and radiation sensitivity , and cellular proliferation . atm-null mice , as well as those null for p53 , develop mainly t-cell lymphomas , supporting the view that these genes have similar roles in thymocyte development . to study the interactions of these two genes on an organismal level , we bred mice heterozygous for null alleles of both atm and p53 to produce all genotypic combinations . mice doubly null for atm and p53 exhibited a dramatic acceleration of tumour formation relative to singly null mice , indicating that both genes collaborate in a significant manner to prevent tumorigenesis . with respect to their roles in apoptosis , loss of atm rendered thymocytes only partly resistant to irradiation-induced apoptosis , whereas additional loss of p53 engendered complete resistance . this implies that the irradiation-induced atm and p53 apoptotic pathways are not completely congruent . finally-and in contrast to prior predictions-atm and p53 do not appear to interact in acute radiation toxicity , suggesting a separate atm effector pathway for this dna damage response and having implications for the prognosis and treatment of human tumours . .;0;0;1;1

increased incidence of cancer in patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia .;objective  previous reports have suggested an increased risk of cancer among patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (chh) . this study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with chh and their first-degree relatives . study design  one hundred twenty-two patients with chh were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986 . their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the population register center . this cohort underwent follow-up for cancer incidence through the finnish cancer registry to the end of 1995 . results  a statistically significant excess risk of cancer was seen among the patients with chh ( standardized incidence ratio 6 . 9 , 95 % confidence interval 2 . 3 to 16 ) , which was mainly attributable to non-hodgkins lymphoma  ( standardized incidence ratio 90 , 95 % confidence interval 18 to 264 ) . in addition , a significant excess risk of basal cell carcinoma was seen ( standardized incidence ratio 35 , 95 % confidence interval 7 . 2 to 102 ) . the cancer incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average cancer incidence in the finnish population . conclusions  this study confirms an increased risk of cancer, especially non-hodgkins lymphoma , probably attributable to defective immunity , among patients with chh .;0;0;1;1
acute encephalopathy and cerebral vasospasm after multiagent chemotherapy including peg-asparaginase and intrathecal cytarabine for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.;a 7-year-old girl with an unusual reaction to induction chemotherapy for precursor b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) is described. the patient developed acute encephalopathy evidenced by behavioral changes, aphasia, incontinence, visual hallucinations, and right-sided weakness with diffuse cerebral vasospasm on magnetic resonance angiography after the administration of intrathecal cytarabine. vincristine, dexamethasone, and polyethylene glycol-asparaginase were also administered before the episode as part of induction therapy. neurologic status returned to baseline within 10 days of the acute event, and magnetic resonance angiography findings returned to normal 4 months later.;0;0;1;1

ethopropazine and benztropine in neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism.;in a 12-week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients. ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine, their previous antiparkinsonian drug. however, benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment, and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients. this suggests that benztropine is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonian symptoms, because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect.;0;0;1;0

neuroleptic malignant syndrome and methylphenidate.;a 1-year-old female presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate. she had defects in the supratentorial brain including the basal ganglia and the striatum (multicystic encephalomalacia) due to severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which was considered to be a possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. a dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally is accepted as the pathogenesis of this syndrome. however, methylphenidate is a dopamine agonist via the inhibition of uptake of dopamine, and therefore dopaminergic systems in the brainstem (mainly the midbrain) and the spinal cord were unlikely to participate in the onset of this syndrome. a relative gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic deficiency might occur because diazepam, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-mimetic agent, was strikingly effective. this is the first reported patient with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate.;0;0;1;0
cloning of the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase gene, the key enzyme of alkaptonuria in mouse.;"we determined 48 amino acid residues from five peptides from the homogeneous monomer of homogentisate 1 , 2-dioxygenase ( hgo ; e . c . 1 . 13 . 11 . 15 ) of mouse liver . after digestion with trypsin , peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography and amino acid sequenced . the deduced codon sequence of three peptides was used to derive degenerated oligomeres . by combining these oligos , we were able to amplify fragments from 100 to 300 bases ( b ) from mouse liver cdna by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription ( rt-pcr ) . a fragment of 200 b was cloned and used as a probe to screen a mouse liver cdna library . one clone from this library contained the complete cdna-insert for hgo as determined by sequencing . the cdna encodes for a protein of 50 kda , as predicted . the cdna of mouse hgo has an overall identity of 41 % to the corresponding gene hmga from aspergillus . sequence similarities to human expressed sequence tags ( est ) clones ranged from 70 % to 20 % . the positions of 122 conserved amino acids could be determined by multiple sequence alignment . we identified one first intron of 928 b in the mouse gene . the gene for hgo seems to be expressed in various tissues , as shown by rt-pcr on different cdnas . fish experiments with the whole murine cdna as probe clearly revealed signals at the human chromosomal band 3q13 . 3-q21 . this corresponds well to the previous assignment of the locus for the human alkaptonuria gene ( aku ) to the same chromosomal region by multipoint linkage analysis . we therefore conclude that the hgo cdna encodes the gene responsible for alkaptonuria .";0;1;1;0

alpha-lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy.;the study investigates if alpha-lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity, if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade, and if neuroprotective effects of alpha-lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection. we used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (drg) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. this approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid. our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons. alpha-lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties. in conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. alpha-lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin. these findings suggest that alpha-lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials.;0;0;1;0

molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations and one polymorphism: implications for structure-function analysis of human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase.;we report here the molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations , l74p and f171s , and one polymorphism , s135l , in human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase ( galt ) . both galactosemia mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstructed in the cdna and overexpressed . the polymorphism , in contrast , has near normal activity . both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved residues , suggesting that they are functionally important , while the polymorphism occurs in a nonconserved domain which is presumably not critical for enzymatic function . the f171s mutation is close to the putative active-site nucleophile . our data further support the notion of molecular heterogeneity of galactosemia and suggest that galactosemia mutations and galt polymorphisms may be useful tools in highlighting different functional domains in human galt . .;0;0;1;0
cloning of human very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase and molecular characterization of its deficiency in two patients.;two overlapping cdna clones ( 1 , 991 bp and 736 bp , respectively ) encoding the precursor of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase ( vlcad ) were cloned and sequenced . the cdna inserts of these clones together encompass a region of 2 , 177 bases , encoding the entire protein of 655 amino acids , including a 40-amino acid leader peptide and a 615-amino acid mature polypeptide . pcr-amplified vlcad cdnas were sequenced in cultured fibroblasts from two vlcad-deficient patients . in both patients , a 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 in vlcad cdna was identified . the deletion seems to occur due to exon skipping during processing of vlcad pre-mrna . this is the first demonstration of a mutation causing vlcad deficiency . quantitative cdna expression of normal human vlcad was performed in the patients fibroblasts , using vaccinia viral system , which demonstrated that the deficiency of the normal vlcad protein causes impaired long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation activity in the patients fibroblasts . in patient fibroblasts , raising vlcad activity to approximately 20 % of normal control fibroblast activity raised palmitic acid beta-oxidation flux to the level found in control fibroblasts , which may offer important information for the rational design of future somatic gene therapy for vlcad deficiency . .;0;0;1;0
characteristics of intergenerational contractions of the ctg repeat in myotonic dystrophy.;in myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) , the size of a ctg repeat in the dm kinase gene generally increases in successive generations with clinical evidence of anticipation . however , there have also been cases with an intergenerational contraction of the repeat . we examined 1 , 489 dm parent-offspring pairs , of which 95 ( 6 . 4 % ) showed such contractions in peripheral blood leukocytes ( pbl ) . in 56 of the 95 pairs , clinical data allowed an analysis of their anticipation status . it is surprising that anticipation occurred in 27 ( 48 % ) of these 56 pairs , while none clearly showed a later onset of dm in the symptomatic offspring . the contraction occurred in 76 ( 10 % ) of 753 paternal transmissions and in 19 ( 3 % ) of 736 maternal transmissions . anticipation was observed more frequently in maternal ( 85 % ) than in paternal ( 37 % ) transmissions ( p dm parents had multiple dm offspring with the ctg repeat contractions . this frequency was higher than the frequency expected from the probability of the repeat contractions ( 6 . 4 % ) and the size of dm sib population ( 1 . 54 dm offspring per dm parent , in 968 dm parents ) . we conclude that ( 1 ) intergenerational contractions of the ctg repeat in leukocyte dna frequently accompanies apparent anticipation , especially when dm is maternally transmitted , and ( 2 ) the paternal origin of the repeat and the presence of the repeat contraction in a sibling increase the probability of the ctg repeat contraction;0;0;1;0
constitutional rb1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma.;in most patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , tumor development is initiated by somatic inactivation of both alleles of the rb1 gene . however , some of these patients can transmit retinoblastoma predisposition to their offspring . to determine the frequency and nature of constitutional rb1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , we analyzed dna from peripheral blood and from tumor tissue . the analysis of tumors from 54 ( 71 % ) of 76 informative patients showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity ( loh ) at intragenic loci . three of 13 uninformative patients had constitutional deletions . for 39 randomly selected tumors , sscp , hetero-duplex analysis , sequencing , and southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations . mutations were detected in 21 ( 91 % ) of 23 tumors with loh . in 6 ( 38 % ) of 16 tumors without loh , one mutation was detected , and in 9 ( 56 % ) of the tumors without loh , both mutations were found . thus , a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients . thirty-nine of the mutations-including 34 small mutations , 2 large structural alterations , and hypermethylation in 3 tumors-were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood dna . in 6 ( 17 % ) of the 36 patients , a mutation was detected in constitutional dna , and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity . the presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment . in 1 patient , somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of dna and rna from peripheral blood . in 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood , mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma . in conclusion , our results emphasize that the manifestation and transmissibility of retinoblastoma depend on the nature of the first mutation , its time in development , and the number and types of cells that are affected . .;0;0;0;1

brca1 deficiency results in early embryonic lethality characterized by neuroepithelial abnormalities.;the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene , brca1 , has been cloned and shown to encode a zinc-finger protein of unknown function . mutations in brca1 account for at least 80 % of families with both breast and ovarian cancer , as well as some non-familial sporadic ovarian cancers . the loss of wild-type brca1 in tumours of individuals carrying one nonfunctional brca1 allele suggests that brca1 encodes a tumour suppressor that may inhibit the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells . to examine the role of brca1 in normal tissue growth and differentiation , and to generate a potential model for the cancer susceptibility associated with loss of brca1 function , we have created a mouse line carrying a mutation in one brca1 allele . analysis of mice homozygous for the mutant allele indicate that brca1 is critical for normal development , as these mice died in utero between 10 and 13 days of gestation ( e10-e13 ) . abnormalities in brca1-deficient embryos were most evident in the neural tube , with 40 % of the embryos presenting with varying degrees of spina bifida and anencephaly . in addition , the neuroepithelium in brca1-deficient embryos appeared disorganized , with signs of both rapid proliferation and excessive cell death . .;0;0;1;1

lone atrial fibrillation associated with creatine monohydrate supplementation.;atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare. therefore, when the arrhythmia is present in this population, reversible causes must be identified and resolved. thyroid disorders, illicit drug or stimulant use, and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes. we report the case of a 30-year-old caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. his medical history was unremarkable, except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot. thyroid-stimulating hormone, magnesium, and potassium levels were within normal limits, urine drug screen was negative, and alcohol use was denied. however, when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements, the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed. the patient was admitted to the hospital, anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin, and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control. when discharged less than 24 hours later, he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin, with follow-up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion. exogenous creatine is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance. vegetarians may also take creatine to replace what they are not consuming from meat, fish, and other animal products. previous anecdotal reports have linked creatine to the development of arrhythmia. clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements. in addition, it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the food and drug administration and in the literature.;1;0;0;0
the dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-associated collagen type ialpha1/platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) b-chain fusion gene generates a transforming protein that is processed to functional pdgf-bb.;dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( dfsp ) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22 , which fuse the collagen type ialpha1 ( colia1 ) gene to the platelet-derived growth factor ( pdgf ) b-chain ( pdgfb ) gene . to characterize the functional and structural properties of the colia1 / pdgfb fusion protein , we generated a stable nih3t3 cell line that contained a tumor-derived chimeric gene resulting from a coia1 intron 7-pdgfb intron 1 fusion . expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells . the pdgf receptor kinase inhibitor cgp57148b reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of colia1 / pdgfb-expressing cells but had no effects on control cells . the presence of dimeric colia1 / pdgfb precursors was demonstrated through pdgfb immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by pdgfb immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with colia1 antibodies . pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the colia1 / pdgfb precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild-type pdgf-bb . finally , colia1 / pdgfb-expressing cells generated tumors after s . c c . injection into nude mice , and tumor growth was reduced by treatment with cgp57148b . we conclude that the colia1 / pdgfb fusion associated with dfsp contributes to tumor development through ectopic production of pdgf-bb and the formation of an autocrine loop . our findings , thus , suggest that pdgf receptors could be a target for pharmacological treatment of dfsp and giant cell fibroblastoma , e . g . , through the use of pdgf receptor kinase inhibitors such as cgp57148b .;0;0;0;1

a highly accurate, low cost test for brca1 mutations.;the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is associated with a high frequency of brca1 mutations . however , the widespread use of brca1 testing has been limited to date by three principal concerns  the fear of loss of health and life insurance , the uncertain clinical value of a positive test result , and the current lack of an inexpensive and sensitive screening test for brca1 mutations . we have developed an inexpensive system for gene mutational scanning , based on a combination of extensive multiplex pcr amplification and two dimensional electrophoresis . the efficiency of this system , as a screening test for brca1 mutations , was evaluated in a panel of 60 samples from high risk women , 14 of which contained a previously identified mutation in brca1 . all 14 mutations were identified , as well as an additional five that had previously escaped detection . in addition to the 19 mutations , a total of 15 different polymorphic variants were scored , most of which were recurring . all were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing . the cost of screening per sample was calculated to be approximately us $ 70 for the manual technique used in this study , and may be reduced to approximately us $ 10 with the introduction of commercially available pcr robotics and fluorescent imaging . implementation of this method of mutation screening in the research and clinical setting should permit rapid accrual of quantitative data on genotype-phenotype associations for the evaluation of diagnostic testing . .;0;0;0;1
duplicational mutation at the duchenne muscular dystrophy locus: its frequency, distribution, origin, and phenotypegenotype correlation.;partial gene deletion is the major cause of mutation leading to duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) and becker muscular dystrophy ( bmd ) . partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases . we have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients , analyzed by southern blot hybridization with clones representing the entire dmd cdna . with careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity , 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene , a frequency of 14 % for nondeletion cases ( 10 / 72 ) , or 6 % for all cases ( 10 / 181 ) . the extent of these duplications has been characterized according to the published exon-containing hindiii fragment map , and in six of the 10 duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected . the resulting translational reading frame of mrna has been predicted for nine duplications . a shift of the reading frame was predicted in four of the six dmd cases and in one of the two intermediate cases , while the reading frame remained uninterrupted in both bmd cases . rflp and quantitative southern blot analyses revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family . in all five families , the duplication was found to originate from a single x chromosome . unequal sister-chromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications . .;0;0;1;0
the effects of dystrophin gene mutations on the erg in mice and humans.;purpose . the authors earlier findings of a negative electroretinogram ( erg ) in a boy with duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) led them to investigate dystrophin gene deletions and ergs in five boys with dmd . the authors wanted to determined whether there were similar erg findings in an animal model for dmd , the mdx mouse . methods . ganzfeld ergs were recorded in five boys with dmd after a complete ophthalmic examination . the dystrophin gene was analyzed by southern blot hybridization . ergs were recorded in anesthetized mdx and control mice with a modified grass photostimulator ( grass instrument company , quincy , ma ) . results . ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings , yet an abnormal negative erg was recorded for each subject . the subjects gene deletions were variable , ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions . the ergs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice . conclusions . the authors believe the unique erg recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of dmd associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity . the erg of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons , including milder effects of the mouse gene defect , differences in muscle and retinal gene product , or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin . the erg shows promise of becoming a noninvasive diagnostic tool for dmd and its milder allelic forms . .;0;0;1;0

dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the dna cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not doxorubicin.;"purpose: the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent dna cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use. dexrazoxane (icrf-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. experimental design: because of their widespread use, the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different dna cleavage enhancers was investigated: sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. likewise, in vivo, b6d2f1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. results: nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. conclusion: although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane. clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity. if successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy.";1;0;1;1

sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated hepatitis b virus-related cirrhosis after treatment with lamivudine monotherapy.;hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection, which causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, remains a major health problem in asian countries. recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers, although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to now. in this report, we encountered a patient with decompensated hbv-related cirrhosis who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy. the patient was a 50-year-old woman. previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient, thus this patient had been referred to our hospital. however, the administration of lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity. during this period, no drug resistant mutant hbv emerged, and the serum hbv-dna level was continuously suppressed. these virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued. moreover, both hepatitis b surface antigen and e antigen were observed to have disappeared in this patient. the administration of lamivudine to patients with hbv-related cirrhosis, like our present case, should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option, especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available.;0;1;0;1

progesterone potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats and beating rat heart cell cultures.;the effects of progesterone treatment on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determined. after determining the bupivacaine ad50 (the concentration of bupivacaine that caused 50% of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become arrhythmic), we determined the effect of 1-hour progesterone hcl exposure on myocyte contractile rhythm. each concentration of progesterone (6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 micrograms/ml) caused a significant and concentration-dependent reduction in the ad50 for bupivacaine. estradiol treatment also increased the arrhythmogenicity of bupivacaine in myocyte cultures, but was only one fourth as potent as progesterone. neither progesterone nor estradiol effects on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity were potentiated by epinephrine. chronic progesterone pretreatment (5 mg/kg/day for 21 days) caused a significant increase in bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in intact pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. there was a significant decrease in the time to onset of arrhythmia as compared with control nonprogesterone-treated rats (6.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 30.8 +/- 2.5 min, mean +/- se). the results of this study indicate that progesterone can potentiate bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity both in vivo and in vitro. potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmia in myocyte cultures suggests that this effect is at least partly mediated at the myocyte level.;1;0;1;0
regional localization of the antagonism of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity by intracerebral calcitonin injections.;calcitonin receptors are found in the brain, and intracerebral infusions of calcitonin can produce behavioral effects. among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. in previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of calcitonin into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens. in the present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake. the areas where calcitonin is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of calcitonin in inhibiting amphetamine-induced locomotor activity.;0;0;1;0

daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase from mc-ixc cells and improves drug-induced amnesia.;the choline acetyltransferase (chat) activator, which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine (ach), is an important factor in the treatment of alzheimer's disease (ad). methanolic extracts from pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on chat in vitro. via the sequential isolation of pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein (4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone). in order to investigate the effects of daidzein from pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests. administration of daidzein (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia, according to the results of a y-maze test. injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior). by way of contrast, mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior). these results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a chat activator, and that it also ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia.;0;0;1;0
chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (cnsha) and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency in a patient with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (fap).;molecular study of a new variant (g6pd clinic) with markedly acidic ph optimum. a new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ) variant with severe erythrocytic g6pd deficiency and a unique ph optimum is described in a young patient with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia ( cnsha ) and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ( fap ) . chronic hemolysis was present in the absence of infections , oxidant drugs or ingestion of faba beans . residual enzyme activity was about 2 . 6 % and 63 % of normal activity in erythrocytes and leucocytes , respectively . a molecular study using standard methods showed g6pd in the patient to have normal electrophoretic mobility ( at ph 7 . 0 , 8 . 0 and 8 . 8 ) , normal apparent affinity for substrates ( km , g6p and nadp ) and a slightly abnormal utilization of substrate analogues ( decreased deamino-nadp and increased 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate utilization ) . heat stability was found to be markedly decreased ( 8 % of residual activity after 20 min of incubation at 46 degrees c ) and a particular characteristic of this enzyme was a biphasic ph curve with a greatly increased activity at low ph . although molecular characteristics of this variant closely resemble those of g6pd bangkok and g6pd duarte , it can be distinguished from these and all other previously reported variants by virtue of its unusual ph curve . therefore the present variant has been designated g6pd clinic to distinguish it from other g6pd variants previously described;0;0;1;0

definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis c virus.;chronic infection with hepatitis c virus (hcv) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. the current best treatment for hcv infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (svrs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic anemia. hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with hcv infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. in general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life. although ribavirin-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing svr rates. recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages. viramidine, a liver-targeting prodrug of ribavirin, has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis c.;1;1;0;1

5 flourouracil-induced apical ballooning syndrome: a case report.;the apical ballooning syndrome (abs) is a recently described stress-mediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient wall-motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular (lv) segments without obstructive epicardial coronary disease. cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents. however, there are no reports of abs secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. we describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer. a 79-year-old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes with significant st-segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram. she underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer. echocardiography revealed a wall-motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared akinetic. coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions. the patient was stabilized with medical therapy. four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic. echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical akinesis. pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiac complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy include coronary vasospasm, endothelial damage and consequent thrombus formation. in our patient, both supraphysiologic levels of plasma catecholamines and stress related neuropeptides caused by cancer diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of abs.;1;0;1;1
inactivation of germline mutant apc alleles by attenuated somatic mutations: a molecular genetic mechanism for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis.;germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) tumor-suppressor gene result in familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) . patients with fap typically develop hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer . a subset of germline apc mutations results in an attenuated fap ( afap ) phenotype , in which patients develop fewer tumors and develop them at an older age . although a genotype-phenotype correlation between the locations of apc germline mutations and the development of afap has been well documented , the mechanism for afap has not been well defined . we investigated the mechanism for afap in patients carrying a mutant apc allele ( apc ( as9 ) ) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9 . apc ( as9 ) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription , the major tumor-suppressor function of apc , as did the wild-type apc . mutation analysis showed that both apc ( as9 ) and the wild-type apc alleles were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients . functional analysis showed that 4666insa , a common somatic mutation in apc ( as9 ) in these tumors , did not inactivate the wild-type apc . our results indicate that carriers of apc ( as9 ) develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical patients with fap because somatic inactivation of both apc alleles is necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis . however , these patients develop colorectal tumors more frequently than does the general population because apc ( as9 ) is inactivated by mutations that do not inactivate the wild-type apc . .;0;0;0;1

severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure secondary to concomitant use of simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir.;"objective: to report a case of a severe interaction between simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir resulting in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. background: a 72-year-old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine for 3 days. the patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg atazanavir daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 u/l creatine kinase, 93 mg/dl blood urea nitrogen, 4.6 mg/dl creatinine, 1579 u/l aspartate aminotransferase, and 738 u/l alanine aminotransferase. simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 u/l and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dl. the patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered. discussion: the risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism. simvastatin is metabolized by cyp3a4. amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized cyp3a4 inhibitors. conclusions: pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions. in patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and cyp3a4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant cyp3a4 inhibitors.";1;1;0;0

on the antiarrhythmic activity of one n-substituted piperazine derivative of trans-2-amino-3-hydroxy-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydroanaphthalene.;the antiarrhythmic activity of the compound n-(trans-3-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)-n-(3-oxo-3-phenyl-2-methylpropyl)-piperazine hydrochloride, referred to as p11, is studied on anaesthesized cats and wistar albino rats, as well as on non-anaesthesized rabbits. four types of experimental arrhythmia are used--with bacl2, with chloroform-adrenaline, with strophantine g and with aconitine. the compound p11 is introduced in doses of 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg intravenously and 10 mg/kg orally. the compound manifests antiarrhythmic activity in all models of experimental arrhythmia used, causing greatest inhibition on the arrhythmia induced by chloroform-adrenaline (in 90 per cent) and with bacl2 (in 84 per cent). the results obtained are associated with the beta-adrenoblocking and with the membrane-stabilizing action of the compound.;1;1;0;0

the pendred syndrome gene encodes a chloride-iodide transport protein.;"pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness and characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goitre . this disorder was mapped to chromosome 7 and the gene causing pendred syndrome ( pds ) was subsequently identified by positional cloning . pds encodes a putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin . pendrin is closely related to a family of sulfate transport proteins that includes the rat sulfate-anion transporter ( encoded by sat-1 ; 29 % amino acid sequence identity ) , the human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter ( encoded by dtd ; 32 % ) and the human sulfate transporter downregulated in adenoma ( encoded by dra ; 45 % ) . on the basis of this homology and the presence of a slightly modified sulfate-transporter signature sequence comprising its putative second transmembrane domain , pendrin has been proposed to function as a sulfate transporter . we were unable to detect evidence of sulfate transport following the expression of pendrin in xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of pds crna or in sf9 cells following infection with pds-recombinant baculovirus . the rates of transport for iodide and chloride were significantly increased following the expression of pendrin in both cell systems . our results demonstrate that pendrin functions as a transporter of chloride and iodide , but not sulfate , and may provide insight into thyroid physiology and the pathophysiology of pendred syndrome . .";0;0;1;0

peripheral neuropathy caused by high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.;"the central nervous system toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside is well recognized, but the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported. a 49-year-old japanese man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. after he achieved complete remission, he received high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment (2 g/m2 twice a day for 5 days; total, 20 g/m2) as consolidation therapy. the first course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of numbness in his right foot. electromyogram and nerve-conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves. this neuropathy was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of graft-versus-host disease, and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone. although the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy are still unclear, high-dose cytosine arabinoside is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms.";0;0;1;1

individual differences in renal ace activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin-induced renal damage.;"background: in man, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) levels, related to ace (i/d) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. this raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ace activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ace activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats. methods: renal ace activity (hip-his-leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male wistar rats. after 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. after 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. results: as anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. baseline renal ace positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, p<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, p<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, p<0.05), interstitial collagen iii (r = 0.53, p<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, p<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, p<0.05). baseline renal ace did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, ns). in controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed. conclusion: individual differences in renal ace activity predict the severity of adriamycin-induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain. this supports the assumption that differences in renal ace activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage.";0;1;0;0
sub-chronic inhibition of nitric-oxide synthesis modifies haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of nadph-diaphorase neurons in mice.;rationale: ng-nitro-l-arginine (l-noarg), an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase (nos), induces catalepsy in mice. this effect undergoes rapid tolerance, showing a significant decrease after 2 days of sub-chronic l-noarg treatment. nitric oxide (no) has been shown to influence dopaminergic neurotransmission in the striatum. neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol, which block dopamine receptors, also cause catalepsy in rodents. objectives: to investigate the effects of subchronic l-noarg treatment in haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of nos neurons in areas related to motor control. methods: male albino swiss mice were treated sub-chronically (twice a day for 4 days) with l-noarg (40 mg/kg i.p.) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.). catalepsy was evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatments. reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (nadph-d) histochemistry was also employed to visualize nos as an index of enzyme expression in mice brain regions related to motor control. results: l-noarg sub-chronic administration produced tolerance of l-noarg and of haloperidol-induced catalepsy. it also induced an increase in the number of nadph-d-positive cells in the dorsal part of the caudate and accumbens nuclei compared with haloperidol and in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared with saline. in contrast, there was a decrease in nadph-d neuron number in the substantia nigra, pars compacta in both haloperidol-treated and l-noarg-treated animals. conclusions: the results give further support to the hypothesis that no plays a role in motor behavior control and suggest that it may take part in the synaptic changes produced by antipsychotic treatment.;0;0;1;0

cardiac arrest in a child with cerebral palsy undergoing sevoflurane induction of anesthesia after preoperative clonidine.;clonidine is a frequently administered alpha2-adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure. we present a case of a 5-year-old child with cerebral palsy and seizure disorder, receiving clonidine for restlessness, who presented for placement of a baclofen pump. without the knowledge of the medical personnel, the patient's mother administered three doses of clonidine during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce anxiety. during induction of anesthesia, the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension requiring cardiac resuscitation. there are no previous reports of clonidine-associated cardiac arrest in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia.;1;0;1;0
ketamine in war/tropical surgery (a final tribute to the racemic mixture).;a technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine was used successfully during the somalia civil war in 1994 and in north uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates. operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air/oxygen only. after premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia, and induction with standard doses of ketamine, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min of ketamine proved safe and effective. emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring, relying heavily on the heart rate. diazepam, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations. local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia. an antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h, glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially in a hot climate. experience in war/tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life-saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where, e.g. amputation and rapid extrication were required.;1;0;0;0

somatic von hippel-lindau mutation in clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis.;papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis is an uncommon benign lesion that may occur sporadically or as a manifestation of von hippel-lindau ( vhl ) disease . neither immunohistochemical studies nor molecular genetic analyses of the vhl gene have been reported previously for this lesion . the authors describe two cases of clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis , both of which were initially confused with metastatic renal cell carcinoma . both lesions showed positive immunohistochemical staining for low and intermediate molecular weight keratins ( cam 5 . 2 and ae1 / ae3 ) , ema , vimentin , alpha 1-antitrypsin , and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin . each was negative for cea . because clear cell papillary cystadenoma is similar to renal cell carcinoma histologically , and because both occur as components of the von hippel-lindau disease complex , the authors analyzed both cases for the presence of mutations in the vhl gene . a somatic vhl gene mutation was detected in one of the two tumors by polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis . direct sequencing revealed a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide 694 , resulting in the replacement of an arginine with a stop codon after the sixth amino acid of exon 3 . as the vhl gene is believed to function as a tumor suppressor gene , vhl gene mutations may play a role in the initiation of tumorigenesis in sporadic cystadenomas of the epididymis .;0;1;0;1
prolonged left ventricular dysfunction occurs in patients with coronary artery disease after both dobutamine and exercise induced myocardial ischaemia.;"objective: to determine whether pharmacological stress leads to prolonged but reversible left ventricular dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease, similar to that seen after exercise. design: a randomised crossover study of recovery time of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function after exercise and dobutamine induced ischaemia. subjects: 10 patients with stable angina, angiographically proven coronary artery disease, and normal left ventricular function. interventions: treadmill exercise and dobutamine stress were performed on different days. quantitative assessment of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was performed using transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals after each test. results: both forms of stress led to prolonged but reversible systolic and diastolic dysfunction. there was no difference in the maximum double product (p = 0.53) or st depression (p = 0.63) with either form of stress. after exercise, ejection fraction was reduced at 15 and 30 minutes compared with baseline (mean (sem), -5.6 (1.5)%, p < 0.05; and -6.1 (2.2)%, p < 0. 01), and at 30 and 45 minutes after dobutamine (-10.8 (1.8)% and -5. 5 (1.8)%, both p < 0.01). regional analysis showed a reduction in the worst affected segment 15 and 30 minutes after exercise (-27.9 (7.2)% and -28.6 (5.7)%, both p < 0.01), and at 30 minutes after dobutamine (-32 (5.3)%, p < 0.01). the isovolumic relaxation period was prolonged 45 minutes after each form of stress (p < 0.05). conclusions: in patients with coronary artery disease, dobutamine induced ischaemia results in prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction, presumed to be myocardial stunning, similar to that seen after exercise. dobutamine induced ischaemia could therefore be used to study the pathophysiology of this phenomenon further in patients with coronary artery disease.";1;0;1;0

the wiskott-aldrich syndrome and x-linked congenital thrombocytopenia are caused by mutations of the same gene.;the wiskott-aldrich syndrome ( was ) is an x-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia , small platelets , eczema , recurrent infections , and immunodeficiency . besides the classic was phenotype , there is a group of patients with congenital x-linked thrombocytopenia ( xlt ) who have small platelets but only transient eczema , if any , and minimal immune deficiency . because the gene responsible for was has been sequenced , it was possible to correlate the was phenotypes with was gene mutations . using a fingerprinting screening technique , we determined the approximate location of the mutation in 13 unrelated was patients with mild to severe clinical symptoms . direct sequence analysis of cdna and genomic dna obtained from patient-derived cell lines showed 12 unique mutations distributed throughout the was gene , including insertions , deletions , and point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions , termination , exon skipping , or splicing defects . of 4 unrelated patients with the xlt phenotype , 3 had missense mutations affecting exon 2 and 1 had a splice-site mutation affecting exon 9 . patients with classic was had more complex mutations , resulting in termination codons , frameshift , and early termination . these findings provide direct evidence that xlt and was are caused by mutations of the same gene and suggest that severe clinical phenotypes are associated with complex mutations . .;0;0;1;0
epileptogenic properties of enflurane and their clinical interpretation.;three cases of eeg changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are reported. in one patient, enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures. until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified, the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants. two other patients suffered from partial, complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication. epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure-free. previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the eeg. on the other hand, enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings.;0;0;1;0

cauda equina syndrome after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% lignocaine: a review of six cases of cauda equina syndrome reported to the swedish pharmaceutical insurance 1993-1997.;six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the swedish pharmaceutical insurance during the period 1993-1997. all were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. five cases had single-shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block. the dose of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg. three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. in the other 3 cases, direct neurotoxicity was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology. all cases sustained permanent neurological deficits. we recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.;0;0;1;0

long-term glutamate supplementation failed to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of paclitaxel.;"toxic peripheral neuropathy is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with paclitaxel (pac), although glutamate and its closely related amino acid glutamine were claimed to ameliorate pac neurotoxicity. this pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of glutamate supplementation for preventing pac-induced peripheral neuropathy in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical and electro-diagnostic study. forty-three ovarian cancer patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same pac-containing regimen: 23 had been supplemented by glutamate all along the treatment period, at a daily dose of three times 500 mg (group g), and 20 had received a placebo (group p). patients were evaluated by neurological examinations, questionnaires and sensory-motor nerve conduction studies. there was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although neurotoxicity symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group g. however, this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported pain sensation (p = 0.011). also the frequency of abnormal electro-diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups (g: 7/23 = 30.4%; p: 6/20 = 30%). this pilot study leads to the conclusion that glutamate supplementation at the chosen regimen fails to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of pac.";0;0;1;1
cardiac toxicity observed in association with high-dose cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.;"introduction: cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens. in high doses, its nonhematological dose-limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy. study design: we combined paclitaxel, melphalan and high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer. analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96-h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure (chf) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (ekg) abnormalities, age, hypertension, prior cardiac history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, prior use of anthracyclines, and left-sided chest irradiation. results: six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 chf following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. incidence of transient cyclophosphamide-related cardiac toxicity (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature. older age was significantly correlated with the chf development; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing chf of 45 and 59, respectively. no association was found with other pretreatment characteristics. conclusions: as a result of these findings, oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients. routine ekg monitoring during infusional cyclophosphamide did not predict chf development.";1;0;0;1

effects of cromakalim and pinacidil on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs.;the effects of i.v. bolus administration of cromakalim (1-10 micrograms/kg) and pinacidil (3-100 micrograms/kg) on large (circumflex artery) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin (0.03-10 micrograms/kg). nitroglycerin, up to 0.3 micrograms/kg, selectively increased circumflex artery diameter (cxad) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter. in contrast, cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms/kg simultaneously and dose-dependently increased cxad, coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure. cromakalim was approximately 8- to 9.5-fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing cxad. vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug-induced tachycardia was abolished. when circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant, the increases in cxad induced by cromakalim (10 micrograms/kg), pinacidil (30 micrograms/kg) and nitroglycerin (10 micrograms/kg) were reduced by 68 +/- 7, 54 +/- 9 and 1 +/- 1%, respectively. thus, whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow-independently dilates large coronary arteries, cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors-mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand. finally, two mechanisms at least, direct vasodilation and flow dependency, are involved in the cromakalim- and pinacidil-induced increase in cxad.;1;0;1;0
compression neuropathy of the radial nerve due to pentazocine-induced fibrous myopathy.;fibrous myopathy is a common, well-known side effect of repeated pentazocine injection. however, compression neuropathy due to fibrotic muscle affected by pentazocine-induced myopathy has not previously been reported. in a 37-year-old woman with documented pentazocine-induced fibrous myopathy of triceps and deltoid muscles bilaterally and a three-week history of right wrist drop, electrodiagnostic examination showed a severe but partial lesion of the right radial nerve distal to the branches to the triceps, in addition to the fibrous myopathy. surgery revealed the right radial nerve to be severely compressed by the densely fibrotic lateral head of the triceps. decompression and neurolysis were performed with good subsequent recovery of function.;0;0;1;0
seizure resulting from a venlafaxine overdose.;objective: to report a case of venlafaxine overdose. case summary: a 40-year-old woman with major depression took an overdose of venlafaxine in an apparent suicide attempt. after the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure. she was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, venlafaxine was discontinued, and no further sequelae were seen. discussion: to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure. based on nonoverdose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine and the potential risks of available interventions, no emergent therapy was instituted. conclusions: the venlafaxine overdose in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized seizure but elicited no further sequelae.;0;0;1;0

statistical analysis of the two stage mutation model in von hippel-lindau disease, and in sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma.;analysis of the age incidence curves for unilateral and bilateral retinoblastoma led knudson to propose that hereditary tumours may arise by a single event and sporadic tumours by a two stage mutation process . it has been suggested recently that sporadic renal cell carcinoma may arise from a two stage mutation process . we analysed the age incidence curves for symptomatic renal cell carcinoma ( n = 26 ) and cerebellar haemangioblastoma ( n = 68 ) in 109 patients with von hippel-lindau ( vhl ) disease , and compared them to 104 patients with sporadic renal cell carcinoma and 43 patients with sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma . the age incidence curves for renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma in vhl disease were compatible with a single mutation model , whereas the age incidence curves for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma suggested a two stage mutation process . these data are compatible with the vhl gene functioning as a recessive tumour suppressor gene . sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma and some renal cell carcinoma may arise from somatic mutations inactivating both alleles at the vhl locus . .;0;1;0;1

paternal transmission of congenital myotonic dystrophy.;we report a rare case of paternally transmitted congenital myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) . the proband is a 23 year old , mentally retarded male who suffers severe muscular weakness . he presented with respiratory and feeding difficulties at birth . his two sibs suffer from childhood onset dm . their late father had the adult type of dm , with onset around 30 years . only six other cases of paternal transmission of congenital dm have been reported recently . we review the sex related effects on transmission of congenital dm . decreased fertility of males with adult onset dm and contraction of the repeat upon male transmission contribute to the almost absent occurrence of paternal transmission of congenital dm . also the fathers of the reported congenitally affected children showed , on average , shorter ctg repeat lengths and hence less severe clinical symptoms than the mothers of children with congenital dm . we conclude that paternal transmission of congenital dm is rare and preferentially occurs with onset of dm past 30 years in the father . .;0;0;1;0

biochemical effects of solidago virgaurea extract on experimental cardiotoxicity.;cardiovascular diseases (cvds) are the major health problem of advanced as well as developing countries of the world. the aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. the subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (mda), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (p < 0.05). pretreatment with s. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations. captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study. the data of the present study suggest that s. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing mda level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol-treated rats. the study emphasizes the beneficial action of s. virgaurea extract as a cardioprotective agent.;1;1;0;0
analysis of meiotic segregation, using single-sperm typing: meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy locus.;meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) locus has recently been suggested as being responsible for maintaining the frequency , in the human population , of dm chromosomes capable of expansion to the disease state . in order to test this hypothesis , we have studied samples of single sperm from three individuals heterozygous at the dm locus , each with one allele larger and one allele smaller than 19 ctg repeats . to guard against the possible problem of differential pcr amplification rates based on the lengths of the alleles , the sperm were also typed at another closely linked marker whose allele size was unrelated to the allele size at the dm locus . using statistical models specifically designed to study single-sperm segregation data , we find no evidence of meiotic segregation distortion . the upper limit of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the estimate of the common segregation probability for the three donors is at or below . 515 for all models considered , and no statistically significant difference from . 5 is detected in any of the models . this suggests that any greater amount of segregation distortion at the myotonic dystrophy locus must result from events following sperm ejaculation .;0;0;1;0

pharmacokinetics of chlorpheniramine, phenytoin, glipizide and nifedipine in an individual homozygous for the cyp2c9*3 allele.;genetic polymorphisms in the cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) family are widely known to contribute to interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetics of many drugs . several alleles for the cyp2c9 gene have been reported . individuals homozygous for the leu359 variant ( cyp2c9 * 3 ) have been shown to have significantly lower drug clearances compared with ile359 ( cyp2c9 * 1 ) homozygous individuals . a male caucasian who participated in six bioavailability studies in our laboratory over a period of several years showed extremely low clearance of two drugs  phenytoin and glipizide ( both substrates of cyp2c9 ) , but not for nifedipine ( a cyp3a4 substrate ) and chlorpheniramine ( a cyp2d6 substrate ) . his oral clearance of phenytoin was 21 % of the mean of the other 11 individuals participating in the study , and his oral clearance of glipizide , a second generation sulfonylurea structurally similar to tolbutamide , was only 188 % of the mean of the other 10 individuals . however , his oral clearance of nifedipine and chlorpheniramine did not differ from individuals in other studies performed at our laboratories . an additional blood sample was obtained from this individual to determine if he possessed any of the known cyp2c9 or cyp2c19 allelic variants that would account for his poor clearance of the cyp2c9 substrates ( phenytoin and glipizide ) compared with the cyp3a4 ( nifedipine ) and cyp2d6 ( chlorpheniramine ) substrates . the results of the genotype testing showed that this individual was homozygous for the cyp2c9 * 3 allele and did not possess any of the known defective cyp2c19 alleles . this study establishes that the leu359 mutation is responsible for the phenytoin and glipizide / tolbutamide poor metabolizer phenotype . .;0;0;1;0
toxicity in rhesus monkeys following administration of the 8-aminoquinoline 8-[(4-amino-l-methylbutyl)amino]- 5-(l-hexyloxy)-6-methoxy-4-methylquinoline (wr242511).;"introduction: many substances that form methemoglobin (mhb) effectively counter cyanide (cn) toxicity. although mhb formers are generally applied as treatments for cn poisoning, it has been proposed that a stable, long-acting mhb former could serve as a cn pretreatment. using this rationale, the 8-aminoquinoline wr242511, a potent long-lasting mhb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential cn pretreatment. methods: in this study, wr242511 was administered intravenously (iv) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and/or 7.0 mg/kg; a single male also received wr242511 orally (po) at 7.0 mg/kg. health status and mhb levels were monitored following exposure. results: the selected doses of wr242511, which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little mhb (mean < 2.0%) in the rhesus monkey. furthermore, transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of wr242511 (3.5 or 7.0 mg/kg), and 2 lethalities occurred (one iv and one po) following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity, with greater severity in the orally-treated animal. conclusions: these data demonstrate direct and/or indirect drug-induced toxicity. it is concluded that wr242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for cn poisoning unless the anti-cn characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable toxicity.";0;1;0;0

massive proteinuria and acute renal failure after oral bisphosphonate (alendronate) administration in a patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.;a 61-year-old japanese man with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy. the amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15.6 to 2.8 g. within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate (alendronate sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with acute renal failure. after discontinuing the oral alendronate, the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of ldl apheresis. urinary volume and serum creatinine levels recovered to the normal range, with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days. this report demonstrates that not only intravenous, but also oral bisphosphonates can aggravate proteinuria and acute renal failure.;0;1;0;0

cis and trans effects of the myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) mutation in a cell culture model.;the mutation causing myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) has been identified as a ctg expansion in the 3-untranslated region ( 3-utr ) of the dm protein kinase gene ( dmpk ) , but the mechanism ( s ) of pathogenesis remain unknown . studies using dm patient materials have often produced confusing results . therefore , to study the effects of the dm mutation in a controlled environment , we have established a cell culture model system using c2c12 mouse myoblasts . by expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human dmpk 3-utr , we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the dm mutation . our data show that a mutant dmpk 3-utr , with as few as 57 ctgs , had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci . we determined by deletion analysis that an expanded ( ctg ) ( n ) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects . furthermore , in contrast to the normal dmpk 3-utr mrna , a mutant dmpk 3-utr mrna with ( cug ) ( 200 ) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of c2c12 myoblasts . genetic analysis and the cre- loxp system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant dmpk 3-utr transcript . characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the ( ctg ) ( n ) expansion and / or the 3 end of the dmpk 3-utr . these results provide evidence that the dm mutation acts in cis to reduce protein production ( consistent with dmpk haploinsufficiency ) and in trans as a riboregulator to inhibit myogenesis . .;0;0;1;0

effect of calcium chloride on gross behavioural changes produced by carbachol and eserine in cats.;"the effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. on the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. it is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. these results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system.";1;0;0;0

"schwartz-jampel syndrome type 2 and stuve-wiedemann syndrome: a case for ""lumping"".";recent studies demonstrated the existence of a genetically distinct , usually lethal form of the schwartz-jampel syndrome ( sjs ) of myotonia and skeletal dysplasia , which we called sjs type 2 . this disorder is reminiscent of another rare condition , the stuve-wiedemann syndrome ( sws ) , which comprises campomelia at birth with skeletal dysplasia , contractures , and early death . to test for possible nosologic identity between these disorders , we reviewed the literature and obtained a follow-up of the only two surviving patients , one with sjs type 2 at age 10 years and another with sws at age 7 years . patients reported as having either neonatal sjs or sws presented a combination of a severe , prenatal-onset neuromuscular disorder ( with congenital joint contractures , respiratory and feeding difficulties , tendency to hyperthermia , and frequent death in infancy ) with a distinct campomelic-metaphyseal skeletal dysplasia . the similarity of the clinical and radiographic findings is so extensive that these disorders appear to be a single entity . the follow-up observation of an identical and unique pattern of progressive bone dysplasia in the two patients ( one with sjs type 2 , one with sws ) surviving beyond infancy adds to the evidence in favor of identity . the hypothesis that sws and sjs type 2 are the same disorder should be testable by molecular methods . .;0;0;1;0
convulsant effect of lindane and regional brain concentration of gaba and dopamine.;lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) is an organochlorine insecticide with known neurotoxic effects. its mechanism of action is not well understood although it has been proposed that lindane acts as a non-competitive antagonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba)-a receptor. we studied the effect of lindane (150 mg/kg) on the gabaergic and dopaminergic systems by measuring the concentration of gaba, dopamine and its metabolites in 7 brain areas at the onset of seizures. all animals suffered tonic convulsions at 18.3 +/- 1.4 min after lindane administration. the concentration of gaba was only slightly but significantly decreased in the colliculi without modifications in the other areas. the concentration of dopamine was increased in the mesencephalon and that of its metabolite dopac was also increased in the mesencephalon and the striatum.;0;0;1;0
the exon 13 duplication in the brca1 gene is a founder mutation present in geographically diverse populations.;the brca1 exon 13 duplication screening group. recently , a 6-kb duplication of exon 13 , which creates a frameshift in the coding sequence of the brca1 gene , has been described in three unrelated u . s s . families of european ancestry and in one portuguese family . here , our goal was to estimate the frequency and geographic diversity of carriers of this duplication . to do this , a collaborative screening study was set up that involved 39 institutions from 19 countries and included 3 , 580 unrelated individuals with a family history of the disease and 934 early-onset breast and / or ovarian cancer cases . a total of 11 additional families carrying this mutation were identified in australia ( 1 ) , belgium ( 1 ) , canada ( 1 ) , great britain ( 6 ) , and the united states ( 2 ) . haplotyping showed that they are likely to derive from a common ancestor , possibly of northern british origin . our results demonstrate that it is strongly advisable , for laboratories carrying out screening either in english-speaking countries or in countries with historical links with britain , to include within their brca1 screening protocols the polymerase chain reaction-based assay described in this report .;0;0;0;1
does domperidone potentiate mirtazapine-associated restless legs syndrome?;there is now evidence to suggest a central role for the dopaminergic system in restless legs syndrome (rls). for example, the symptoms of rls can be dramatically improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists, whereas central dopamine d2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate rls symptoms. to our knowledge, there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine d2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or aggravate symptoms of rls. mirtazapine, the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (nassa), has been associated with rls in several recent publications. the authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed rls after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy. our patient started to have symptoms of rls only after he had been treated with mirtazapine, and his rls symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine. such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of rls in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine-associated rls. however, physicians should be aware of the possibility that mirtazapine can be associated with rls in some individuals, especially those receiving concomitant dopamine d2 receptor antagonists.;0;0;1;0
antitumor effect, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin in the igm solid immunocytoma-bearing lou/m/wsl rat.;antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity induced by doxorubicin were studied in lou/m/wsl inbred rats each bearing a transplantable solid igm immunocytoma. animals with a tumor (diameter, 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm) were treated with iv injections of doxorubicin on 5 consecutive days, followed by 1 weekly injection for 7 weeks (dose range, 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt). tumor regression was observed with 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg. complete disappearance of the tumor was induced with 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. histologic evidence of cardiotoxicity scored as grade iii was only observed at a dose of 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. light microscopic evidence of renal damage was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, which resulted in albuminuria and very low serum albumin levels. in the group that received 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg, the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter. ascites and hydrothorax were observed simultaneously. the same experiments were performed with non-tumor-bearing rats, in which no major differences were observed. in conclusion, antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were studied simultaneously in the same lou/m/wsl rat. albuminuria due to renal damage led to extremely low serum albumin levels, so ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily a consequence of the observed cardiomyopathy.;1;1;0;1
functional link between ataxia-telangiectasia and nijmegen breakage syndrome gene products.;ataxia-telangiectasia ( a-t ) and nijmegen breakage syndrome ( nbs ) are recessive genetic disorders with susceptibility to cancer and similar cellular phenotypes . the protein product of the gene responsible for a-t , designated atm , is a member of a family of kinases characterized by a carboxy-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain . the nbs1 protein is specifically mutated in patients with nijmegen breakage syndrome and forms a complex with the dna repair proteins rad50 and mrel1 . here we show that phosphorylation of nbs1 , induced by ionizing radiation , requires catalytically active atm . complexes containing atm and nbs1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation . we have identified two residues of nbs1 , ser 278 and ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by atm and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to dna damage . this response includes s-phase checkpoint activation , formation of the nbs1 / mrel1 / rad50 nuclear foci and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation . together , these results demonstrate a biochemical link between cell-cycle checkpoints activated by dna damage and dna repair in two genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes . .;0;0;1;1
immunopathology of penicillamine-induced glomerular disease.;four patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed heavy proteinuria after five to 12 months of treatment with d-penicillamine. light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase, or no departure from normal. electron microscopy, however, revealed subepithelial electron-dense deposits, fusion of epithelial cell foot processes, and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity. immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of igg and c3. the findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis, differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early-acting complement components c1q and c4. it is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway.;0;1;0;0
does supplemental vitamin c increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes?;"background: vitamin c acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro. these observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin c in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis. objective: the objective was to examine the relation between vitamin c intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease. design: we studied the relation between vitamin c intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease (n = 281), coronary artery disease (n = 175), and stroke (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline. diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. results: after adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, vitamin e, and beta-carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (p for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total vitamin c intake from food and supplements. adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1.0, 0.81, 0.99, 1.26, and 1.91 (p for trend = 0.01) and of stroke were 1.0, 0.52, 1.23, 2.22, and 2.57 (p for trend < 0.01). when dietary and supplemental vitamin c were analyzed separately, only supplemental vitamin c showed a positive association with mortality endpoints. vitamin c intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline. conclusion: a high vitamin c intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with diabetes.";1;0;1;0

the hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog: a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man.;"cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man, the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized. there is a need for a well-defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied. in four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose-dependent incidence of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia after 1-3 months of treatment. a nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg/kg cefonicid or 540-840 mg/kg cefazedone. all three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron (approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets (hours to a few days). upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin, the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid (but not cefazedone)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +/- 24 days). this observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia. we conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin-induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.";0;0;1;0

use of propranolol in the treatment of idiopathic orthostatic hypotension.;five patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe autonomic dysfunction were included in the study. they all exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamines and plasma renin activity in both recumbent and upright positions and had marked hypersensitivity to the pressor effects of infused norepinephrine. treatment with propanolol administered intravenously (1-5 mg) produced increases in supine and upright blood pressure in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11/6 to 22/11 mmhg. chronic oral administration of propranolol (40-160 mg/day) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20-35/15-25 mmg being observed. in 1 patient, marked hypertension was induced by propranolol and the drug had to be withdrawn. it otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were observed. treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6-13 months with persistence of the pressor effect, although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time. hemodynamic measurements in 1 of the patients demonstrated an increase in total peripheral resistance and essentially no change in cardiac output following propranolol therapy. the studies suggest that propranolol is a useful drug in selected patients with severe idiopathic orthostatic hypotension.;1;0;0;0

retinoschisin, the x-linked retinoschisis protein, is a secreted photoreceptor protein, and is expressed and released by weri-rb1 cells.;x-linked retinoschisis is characterized by microcystic-like changes of the macular region and schisis within the inner retinal layers , leading to visual deterioration in males . many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene rs1 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating . rs1 encodes a 224 amino acid protein , retinoschisin , which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function . we have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin , which detects a protein of approximately 28 kda in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol , but multimers sized > 40 kda under non-reducing conditions . a screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae . we investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both rs1 mrna ( using in situ hybridization with riboprobes ) and retinoschisin ( using immunohistochemistry ) . the antisense riboprobe detected rs1 mrna only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina . furthermore , differentiated retinoblastoma cells ( weri-rb1 cells ) were found to express rs1 mrna and to release retinoschisin . these results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo-receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers . thus , x-linked retinoschisis is caused by abnormalities in a putative secreted photoreceptor protein and is the first example of a secreted photo-receptor protein associated with a retinal dystrophy . .;0;0;1;0

gene therapy for phenylketonuria.;classical phenylketonuria ( pku ) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) . limitations of the current dietary treatment for pku have led to the development of potential treatments based on somatic gene transfer . three different vector systems have been examined . vectors derived from a recombinant retrovirus or a dna / protein complex can efficiently transduce the pah cdna into pah-deficient hepatocytes in vitro , but the application of these vector systems is presently limited by their low transduction efficiency in vivo . in contrast , a vector derived from a recombinant adenovirus can restore 10 % -80 % of normal hepatic pah activity into pah-deficient mice , which completely normalizes serum phenylalanine levels . this treatment is transient and cannot be effectively re-administered due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies directed against the recombinant adenoviral vector . however , these findings suggest that pku can be completely corrected by somatic gene therapy , and provide some direction for the future development of adenoviral vectors . .;0;1;1;0

detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy with iodine-125-metaiodobenzylguanidine.;radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (mibg), an analog of norepinephrine (ne), serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function. using a rat model of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in adriamycin cardiomyopathy. the degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment (2 mg/kg, once a week). there were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1- or 2-wk treatment groups, isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3-wk group, frequent scattered degeneration in the 4-wk group, scattered or focal degeneration in the 5-wk group, and extensive degeneration in the 8-wk group. myocardial accumulation of [125i]mibg 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less. however, the 4-wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall (82% of the control) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall (about 66% of the control: p less than 0.05). in the 5-wk group, mibg accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35% and 27% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). in the 8-wk group, mibg accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18% and 14% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). thus, mibg accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose-dependent manner. the appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment (scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration) indicates that mibg scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.;1;0;1;0
alstrom syndrome: further evidence for linkage to human chromosome 2p13.;alstrom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinal degeneration , sensorineural hearing loss , early-onset obesity , and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus . the gene for alstrom syndrome ( alms1 ) has been previously localized to human chromosome 2p13 by homozygosity mapping in two distinct isolated populations - french acadian and north african . pair-wise analyses resulted in maximum lod ( logarithm of the odds ratio ) scores of 3 . 84 and 2 . 9 , respectively . to confirm these findings , a large linkage study was performed in twelve additional families segregating for alstrom syndrome . a maximum two-point lod score of 7 . 13 ( theta = 0 . 00 ) for marker d2s2110 and a maximum cumulative multipoint lod score of 9 . 16 for marker d2s2110 were observed , further supporting linkage to chromosome 2p13 . no evidence of genetic heterogeneity was observed in these families . meiotic recombination events have localized the critical region containing alms1 to a 6 . 1-cm interval flanked by markers d2s327 and d2s286 . a fine resolution radiation hybrid map of 31 genes and markers has been constructed .;0;0;1;0

chloroacetaldehyde as a sulfhydryl reagent: the role of critical thiol groups in ifosfamide nephropathy.;chloroacetaldehyde (caa) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide (ifo) and putatively responsible for renal damage following anti-tumor therapy with ifo. depletion of sulfhydryl (sh) groups has been reported from cell culture, animal and clinical studies. in this work the effect of caa on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture (hrptec) was investigated. toxicity of caa was determined by protein content, cell number, ldh release, trypan blue exclusion assay and caspase-3 activity. free thiols were measured by the method of ellman. caa reduced hrptec cell number and protein, induced a loss in free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers. caa but not acrolein inhibited the cysteine proteases caspase-3, caspase-8 and cathepsin b. caspase activation by cisplatin was inhibited by caa. in cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, caa induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage. the effects of caa on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate. acidification, which slowed the reaction of caa with thiol donors, could also attenuate effects of caa on necrosis markers, thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells. thus, caa directly reacts with cellular protein and non-protein thiols, mediating its toxicity on hrptec. this effect can be reduced by acidification. therefore, urinary acidification could be an option to prevent ifo nephropathy in patients.;0;1;0;1

lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis b virus reactivation in hepatitis-b surface antigen (hbsag) seropositive cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy.;"hepatitis b virus (hbv) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. cancer patients who are chronic carriers of hbv have a higher hepatic complication rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (ct) and this has mainly been attributed to hbv reactivation. in this study, cancer patients who have solid and hematological malignancies with chronic hbv infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior and during ct compared with historical control group who did not receive lamivudine. the objectives were to assess the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of hbv reactivation, and diminishing morbidity and mortality during ct. two groups were compared in this study. the prophylactic lamivudin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treatment. the historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent ct without prophylactic lamivudine. they were followed up during and for 8 weeks after ct. the outcomes were compared for both groups. of our control group (n= 50), 21 patients (42%) were established hepatitis. twelve (24%) of them were evaluated as severe hepatitis. in the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient (2.7%) of 37 patients (p < 0.006). comparison of the mean alt values revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase (alt) values in the control group than the prophylactic lamivudine group; 154:64 (p < 0.32). our study suggests that prophylactic lamivudine significantly decreases the incidence of hbv reactivation and overall morbidity in cancer patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy. further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate nucleoside or nucleotide analogue for antiviral prophylaxis during ct and the optimal duration of administration after completion of ct.";0;1;0;1
identification of a novel nonsense mutation and a missense substitution in the vasopressin-neurophysin ii gene in two spanish kindreds with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.;familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( fndi ) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin ( avp ) encoded by the avp-neurophysin ii ( avp-npii ) gene on chromosome 20p13 . in this study , we analyzed two families with fndi using direct automated fluorescent , solid phase , single-stranded dna sequencing of pcr-amplified avp-npii dna . in one of the families , affected individuals presented a novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the gene , consisting in a g to t transition at nucleotide 2101 , which produces a stop signal in codon 82 ( glu ) of npii . the premature termination eliminates part of the c-terminal domain of npii , including a cysteine residue in position 85 , which could be involved in the correct folding of the prohormone . in the second family , a g279a substitution at position -1 of the signal peptide was observed in all affected individuals . this missense mutation , which replaces ala with thr , is frequent among fndi patients and is thought to reduce the efficiency of cleavage by signal peptidases . .;0;0;1;0
increased serum soluble fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose.;"background/aims: experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the fas/fas ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure. the aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of fas in patients with acute liver failure. methodology: serum levels of sfas (soluble fas) were measured by elisa in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects. serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were also determined by elisa. results: serum sfas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure (median, 26.8 u/ml; range, 6.9-52.7 u/ml) compared to the normal controls (median, 8.6 u/ml; range, 6.5-12.0 u/ml, p < 0.0001). levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose (median, 28.7 u/ml; range, 12.8-52.7 u/ml, n = 17) than those due to non-a to e hepatitis (median, 12.5 u/ml; range, 6.9-46.0 u/ml, n = 7, p < 0.01). there was no relationship of sfas to eventual outcome in the patients. a significant correlation was observed between serum sfas levels and aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.613, p < 0.01). conclusions: the increased concentration of sfas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of fas-mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss.";0;1;1;1

small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide n (snrpn), an expressed gene in the prader-willi syndrome critical region.;prader-willi syndrome ( pws ) is associated with paternally derived chromosomal deletions in region 15q11-13 or with maternal disomy for chromosome 15 . therefore , loss of the expressed paternal alleles of maternally imprinted genes must be responsible for the pws phenotype . we have mapped the gene encoding the small nuclear rna associated polypeptide smn ( snrpn ) to human chromosome 15q12 and a processed pseudogene snrpnp1 to chromosome region 6pter-p21 . furthermore , snrpn was mapped to the minimal deletion interval that is critical for pws . the fact that the mouse snrpn gene is maternally imprinted in brain suggests that loss of the paternally derived snrpn allele may be involved in the pws phenotype . .;0;0;1;0
norrie disease gene: characterization of deletions and possible function.;"positional cloning experiments have resulted recently in the isolation of a candidate gene for norrie disease ( pseudoglioma ; ndp ) , a severe x-linked neurodevelopmental disorder . here we report the isolation and analysis of human genomic dna clones encompassing the ndp gene . the gene spans 28 kb and consists of 3 exons , the first of which is entirely contained within the 5 untranslated region . detailed analysis of genomic deletions in norrie patients shows that they are heterogeneous , both in size and in position . by pcr analysis , we found that expression of the ndp gene was not confined to the eye or to the brain . an extensive dna and protein sequence comparison between the human ndp gene and related genes from the database revealed homology with cysteine-rich protein-binding domains of immediate--early genes implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation . we propose that ndp is a molecule related in function to these genes and may be involved in a pathway that regulates neural cell differentiation and proliferation . .";0;0;1;0
atm germline mutations in classical ataxia-telangiectasia patients in the dutch population.;germline mutations in the atm gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia ( a-t ) . in our study , we have determined the atm mutation spectrum in 19 classical a-t patients , including some immigrant populations , as well as 12 of dutch ethnic origin . both the protein truncation test ( ptt ) and the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting ( ref ) method were used and compared for their detection efficiency , identifying 76 % and 60 % of the mutations , respectively . most patients were found to be compound heterozygote . seventeen mutations were distinct , of which 10 were not reported previously . mutations are small deletions or point mutations frequently affecting splice sites . moreover , a 16 . 7-kb genomic deletion of the 3 end of the gene , most likely a result of recombination between two line elements , was identified . the most frequently found mutation , identified in three unrelated turkish a-t individuals , was previously described to be a turkish a-t founder mutation . the presence of a founder mutation among relatively small ethnic population groups in western europe could indicate a high carrier frequency in such communities . in patients of dutch ethnic origin , however , no significant founder effect could be identified . the observed genetic heterogeneity including the relative high percentage of splice-site mutations had no reflection on the phenotype . all patients manifested classical a-t and increased cellular radioresistant dna synthesis .;0;0;1;0

classical galactosemia and mutations at the galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galt) gene.;classical galactosemia is caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase ( galt ) , which , in turn , is caused by mutations at the galt gene . the disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and , at the end of 1998 , more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide . the mutations most frequently cited are q188r , k285n , s135l , and n314d . q188r is the most common mutation in european populations or in those predominantly of european descent . overall , it accounts for 60-70 % of mutant chromosomes , but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations . individuals homoallelic for q188r tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems . globally , k285n is rarer , but in many european populations it can be found on 25-40 % of mutant chromosomes . it is invariably associated with a severe phenotype . s135l is found almost exclusively in african americans . in vitro expression results are discrepant , but some individuals carrying s135l appear to exhibit galt activity in some tissues . duarte 1 ( or los angeles ) and duarte 2 ( or duarte ) variants carry the same amino acid substitution , n314d , even though d1 is associated with increased erythrocyte galt activity and d2 with reduced activity . n314d is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the d1 and d2 alleles . n314d does not impair galt activity in in vitro expression systems . however , there are differences in the abundance of galt protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from d2 and d1 individuals . it is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the d1 and d2 alleles account for the different activities . the considerable genetic heterogeneity documented to date undoubtedly contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed in galactosemia . the additional effects of nonallelic variation and other constitutional factors on phenotypic variability remain to be elucidated . .;0;0;1;0
effect of polyethylene glycol 400 on adriamycin toxicity in mice.;the effect of a widely used organic solvent, polyethylene glycol 400 (peg 400), on the toxic action of an acute or chronic treatment with adriamycin (adr) was evaluated in mice. peg 400 impressively decreased both acute high-dose and chronic low-dose-adr-associated lethality. light microscopic analysis showed a significant protection against adr-induced cardiac morphological alterations. such treatment did not diminish the adr antitumor activity in l1210 leukemia and in ehrlich ascites tumor.;0;0;0;1
ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients.;it is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients. clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction, such as fasting, may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis. in this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment, who often had to fast in the post-operative period. fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms. of those, 13 (26%) developed biliary pathology. comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age, sex, duration of the treatment and starvation variables. after cessation of the treatment, pseudolithiasis resolved spontaneously within a short period. the incidence of pseudolithiasis is not affected by fasting.;0;1;1;0

mutations in the rb1 gene and their effects on transcription.;"inactivation of both alleles of the rb1 gene during normal retinal development initiates the formation of a retinoblastoma ( rb ) tumor . to identify the mutations which inactivate rb1 , 21 rb tumors isolated from 19 patients were analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction or an rnase protection assay or both . mutations were identified in 13 of 21 rb tumors ; in 8 tumors , the precise errors in nucleotide sequence were characterized . each of four germ line mutations involved a small deletion or duplication , while three somatic mutations were point mutations leading to splice alterations and loss of an exon from the mature rb1 mrna . we were unable to detect expression of the mutant allele in lymphoblasts of three bilaterally affected patients , although the mutation was present in the genomic dna and transcripts containing the mutations were obvious in the rb tumors in the absence of a normal rb1 allele . the variations in the level of expression of mutant transcripts suggest deregulation of rb1 transcription in the absence of a functional rb1 gene product . .";0;0;0;1
flumazenil induces seizures and death in mixed cocaine-diazepam intoxications.;study hypothesis: administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may unmask seizures in mixed cocaine-benzodiazepine intoxication. design: male sprague-dawley rats received 100 mg/kg cocaine ip alone, 5 mg/kg diazepam alone, or a combination of diazepam and cocaine. three minutes later, groups were challenged with vehicle or flumazenil 5 or 10 mg/kg ip. animal behavior, seizures (time to and incidence), death (time to and incidence), and cortical eeg tracings were recorded. interventions: administration of flumazenil to animals after they had received a combination dose of cocaine and diazepam. results: in group 1, animals received cocaine followed by vehicle. this resulted in 100% developing seizures and death. group 2 received diazepam alone followed by vehicle. animals became somnolent and none died. group 3 received diazepam followed by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. animals became somnolent after diazepam and then active after flumazenil administration. in group 4, a combination of cocaine and diazepam was administered simultaneously. this resulted in no overt or eeg-detectable seizures and a 50% incidence of death. group 5 received a similar combination of cocaine and diazepam, followed later by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. this resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (p < .01), and death, 100% (p < or = .01), compared with group 4. group 6 received cocaine and diazepam followed by 10 mg/kg flumazenil. this also resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (p < or = .01), and death, 90% (p < or = .05), compared with group 4. conclusion: flumazenil can unmask seizures and increase the incidence of death in a model of combined cocaine-diazepam intoxications.;0;0;1;0

homozygosity mapping in a family with microcephaly, mental retardation, and short stature to a cohen syndrome region on 8q21.;3-8q22.1: redefining a clinical entity. a syndrome of microcephaly , progressive postnatal growth deficiency , and mental retardation was observed in two brothers and their cousin from a multiply consanguineous kindred of lebanese descent . hypotonia , chorioretinal dystrophy , and myopia were also identified . the severity of the condition varied among the closely related patients . because of absence of a distinctive facial appearance , the degree of mental retardation , and short stature , the initially considered clinical diagnosis of cohen syndrome was withdrawn and a novel genetic entity was assumed . homozygosity mapping in this family assigned the gene to a 26 . 8-cm region on the chromosome band 8q21 . 3 -22 . 1 , between the microsatellites at d8s270 and d8s514 . the maximum two-point lod score was found for marker at d8s267 ( zmax = 3 . . 237 at omax = 0 . 00 ) . intriguingly enough , the identified gene region overlaps the refined gene region for cohen syndrome ( coh1 ) [ kolehmainen et al . , 1997  euro j hum genet 5  206-213 ] . this fact encourages the hypothesis that the described kindred segregates for a variant of cohen syndrome and suggests a redefinition of its phenotype;0;0;1;0

effects of a new calcium antagonist, cd-832, on isoproterenol-induced myocardial ischemia in dogs with partial coronary stenosis.;effects of cd-832 on isoproterenol (iso)-induced myocardial ischemia were studied in dogs with partial coronary stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery and findings were compared with those for nifedipine or diltiazem. in the presence of coronary artery stenosis, 3-min periods of intracoronary iso infusion (10 ng/kg/min) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise, which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and st-segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram. after the control iso infusion with stenosis was performed, equihypotensive doses of cd-832 (3 and 10 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7), nifedipine (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min, n = 9) or diltiazem (10 and 30 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third iso infusion. both cd-832 and diltiazem, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by iso infusion. in contrast to nifedipine, cd-832 (10 micrograms/kg/min) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 +/- 12% to 115 +/- 26% of the control value (p < .01) and st-segment elevation from 5.6 +/- 1.0 mv to 1.6 +/- 1.3 mv (p < .01) at 3 min after iso infusion with stenosis. diltiazem (30 micrograms/kg/min) also prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 34 +/- 14% to 63 +/- 18% of the control value (p < .05) and st-segment elevation from 4.7 +/- 0.7 mv to 2.1 +/- 0.7 mv (p < .01) at 3 min after iso infusion with stenosis. these data show that cd-832 improves myocardial ischemia during iso infusion with stenosis and suggest that the negative chronotropic property of cd-832 plays a major role in the beneficial effects of cd-832.;1;0;1;0

activation of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase contributes to development of doxorubicin-induced heart failure.;activation of the nuclear enzyme poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) by oxidant-mediated dna damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress. increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (dox), a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic. thus, we hypothesized that the activation of parp may contribute to the dox-induced cardiotoxicity. using a dual approach of parp-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone parp inhibitor pj34, we now demonstrate the role of parp in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by dox. parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- mice received a single injection of dox (25 mg/kg i.p). five days after dox administration, left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in parp-1+/+ mice, but only to a smaller extent in parp-1-/- ones. similar experiments were conducted in balb/c mice treated with pj34 or vehicle. treatment with a pj34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals. in addition pj34 significantly reduced the dox-induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart. thus, parp activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of dox. parp inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe cardiac complications associated with the dox treatment.;1;0;0;1

heparin-induced thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation.;background: unfractionated heparin sodium (ufh) or low-molecular weight heparin (lmwh) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation. heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%. the frequencies of hit after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin-reactive antibody (hit antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown. patients and methods: the 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation. we started lmwh (25 iu/kg/h) on postoperative day (pod) 1, switching to ufh (5000 u/d) on pod 2 or 3. the dose of ufh was changed according to the activated clotting time level. hit antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on pod 7 and 14. platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks. results: the average platelet counts preoperatively, and on pod 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10(9)/l, respectively. two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on pod 11 and 19, respectively, although they were hit antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable. in 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10(9)/l on pod 4 to 65 x 10(9)/l on pod 6 and from 76 x 10(9)/l on pod 7 to 33 x 10(9)/l on pod 9, respectively. the heparin-induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients. the percentage of hit antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on pod 7, and 5.6% on pod 14. none of the subjects/patients developed ufh-related hit. conclusions: in our series, the occurrence of hit after liver transplantation was uncommon.;1;1;0;0

d-penicillamine-induced angiopathy in rats. the effect of high dose d-penicillamine treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel.;male sprague-dawley rats were treated with d-penicillamine (d-pen) 500 mg/kg/day for 10 or 42 days. pair fed rats served as controls. changes in aortic morphology were examined by light- and transmission-electron microscopy (tem). in addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131i-albumin (131i-hsa). tem revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of d-pen-treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation. in experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells. the aorta/serum-ratio and the radioactive build-up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131i-hsa was reduced in animals treated with d-pen for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate. the endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by d-pen, and no differences in aortic 131i-hsa radioactivity or aorta/serum-ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by d-pen treatment. these observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of d-pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta, possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross-linking of collagen and elastin.;1;0;0;0

cardiac transplantation: improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol.;the effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients. in group i, cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17.5 mg/kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng/ml. in group ii, cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine, which was used for the first postoperative week. group ii showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. group ii also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long-term therapy with cyclosporine. despite this improvement in late renal function, group ii still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine. we think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect.;1;1;0;0
reduced progression of adriamycin nephropathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated by losartan.;background: the aim of the study was to investigate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin ii type-1 receptor blocker, losartan, and its potential in slowing down renal disease progression in spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) with adriamycin (adr) nephropathy. methods: six-month-old female shr were randomly selected in six groups. two control groups (sh(6), sh(12)) received vehicle. groups adr(6), adr+los(6) and adr(12), and adr+los(12) received adr (2 mg/kg/b.w. i.v.) twice in a 3-week interval. group adr+los(6) received losartan (10 mg/kg/b.w./day by gavages) for 6 weeks and group adr+los(12) for 12 weeks after second injection of adr. animals were killed after 6 or 12 weeks, respectively. haemodynamic measurements were performed on anaesthetized animals, blood and urine samples were taken for biochemical analysis and the left kidney was processed for morphological studies. results: short-term losartan treatment, besides antihypertensive effect, improved glomerular filtration rate and ameliorated glomerulosclerosis resulting in decreased proteinuria. prolonged treatment with losartan showed further reduction of glomerulosclerosis associated with reduced progression of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, thus preventing heavy proteinuria and chronic renal failure. losartan reduced uraemia and increased urea clearance in advanced adr nephropathy in shr. histological examination showed that losartan could prevent tubular atrophy, interstitial infiltration and fibrosis in adr nephropathy. conclusion: losartan reduces the rate of progression of adr-induced focal segmental glomerulosclerosis to end-stage renal disease in shr.;0;1;0;0
two new arylsulfatase a (arsa) mutations in a juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy (mld) patient.;fragments of the arylsulfatase a ( arsa ) gene from a patient with juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy ( mld ) were amplified by pcr and ligated into mp13 cloning vectors . clones hybridizing with cdna for human arsa were selected , examined for appropriate size inserts , and used to prepare single-stranded phage dna . examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations . one , a point mutation in exon 3 , resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine . introduction of this alteration into the normal arsa cdna sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in arsa activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells . about 5 % of the control expression was observed , suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated arsa . the second mutation , a g-to-a transition , occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron . the mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site . apparently normal levels of mrna were generated from this allele , but no arsa activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected . a collection of dna samples from known or suspected mld patients , members of their families , and normal controls was screened for these mutations . four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 mld patients in the sample . gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data . no individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified . however , combinations with other mld mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the disease . the splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile mld when combined with other enzyme-null mutations , implying that it is completely silent enzymatically . .;0;1;1;0
factors contributing to ribavirin-induced anemia.;background and aim: interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis c produces hemolytic anemia. this study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to ribavirin-induced anemia. methods: eighty-eight patients with chronic hepatitis c who received interferon-alpha-2b at a dose of 6 mu administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study. a hemoglobin concentration of <10 g/dl was defined as ribavirin-induced anemia. results: ribavirin-induced anemia occurred in 18 (20.5%) patients during treatment. a 2 g/dl decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment. the hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or =2 g/dl decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with <2 g/dl decrease (p < 0.01). a significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of anemia (p < 0.01). such factors as sex (female), age (> or =60 years old), and the ribavirin dose by body weight (12 mg/kg or more) were significant by univariate analysis. conclusions: careful administration is necessary in patients > or =60 years old, in female patients, and in patients receiving a ribavirin dose of 12 mg/kg or more. patients who experience a fall in hemoglobin concentrations of 2 g/dl or more at week 2 after the start of treatment should be monitored with particular care.;0;1;0;0

an unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by mepivacaine with adrenaline.;an increase in blood pressure, accompanied by atrial fibrillation, agitation, incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness, was observed in an elderly, asa classification group ii, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0.225 mg, for correction of dupuytren's contracture. after intravenous administration of labetalol, metoprolol and midazolam the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up. the block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation. postoperatively, the patient refused dc cardioversion and was treated medically. both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications.;1;1;0;0
people aged over 75 in atrial fibrillation on warfarin: the rate of major hemorrhage and stroke in more than 500 patient-years of follow-up.;objectives: to determine the incidence of major hemorrhage and stroke in people aged 76 and older with atrial fibrillation on adjusted-dose warfarin who had been recently been admitted to hospital. design: a retrospective observational cohort study. setting: a major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals. participants: two hundred thirty-five patients aged 76 and older admitted to a major healthcare network between july 1, 2001, and june 30, 2002, with atrial fibrillation on warfarin were enrolled. measurements: information regarding major bleeding episodes, strokes, and warfarin use was obtained from patients, relatives, primary physicians, and medical records. results: two hundred twenty-eight patients (42% men) with a mean age of 81.1 (range 76-94) were included in the analysis. total follow-up on warfarin was 530 years (mean 28 months). there were 53 major hemorrhages, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal bleeds. the annual stroke rate after initiation of warfarin was 2.6%. conclusion: the rate of major hemorrhage was high in this old, frail group, but excluding fatalities, resulted in no long-term sequelae, and the stroke rate on warfarin was low, demonstrating how effective warfarin treatment is.;1;0;0;0
a strong candidate for the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca1.;a strong candidate for the 17q-linked brca1 gene , which influences susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer , has been identified by positional cloning methods . probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate brca1 susceptibility alleles . the mutations include an 11-base pair deletion , a 1-base pair insertion , a stop codon , a missense substitution , and an inferred regulatory mutation . the brca1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues , including breast and ovary , and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids . this protein contains a zinc finger domain in its amino-terminal region , but is otherwise unrelated to previously described proteins . identification of brca1 should facilitate early diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility in some individuals as well as a better understanding of breast cancer biology . .;0;0;0;1
vasopressin in the treatment of milrinone-induced hypotension in severe heart failure.;the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone in the treatment of severe heart failure is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and hypotension. in patients with decompensated heart failure with hypotension after treatment with milrinone, low doses of vasopressin restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of milrinone.;1;0;0;0
sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for calcineurin-free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.;calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, have been available for almost 20 years. although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression, they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity. acute nephrotoxicity, which occurs in the early period after transplantation, leads to a higher rate of dialysis, and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss. acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases. two recently available immunosuppressive agents, mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus (rapamycin), have no nephrotoxicity. the use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy. this paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.;0;1;1;0
neuroprotective action of mpep, a selective mglur5 antagonist, in methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is associated with a decrease in dopamine outflow and inhibition of hyperthermia in rats.;"the aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mglur5) in the toxic action of methamphetamine on dopaminergic neurones in rats. methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc), administered five times, reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection. a selective antagonist of mglur5, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (mpep; 5 mg/kg ip), when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above-mentioned methamphetamine effects. a single mpep (5 mg/kg ip) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum, as well as dopamine release stimulated either by methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine (100 microm). moreover, it transiently diminished the methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc)-induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature. mpep administered into the striatum at high concentrations (500 microm) increased extracellular dopamine levels, while lower concentrations (50-100 microm) were devoid of any effect. the results of this study suggest that the blockade of mglur5 by mpep may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine-induced toxicity. neuroprotection rendered by mpep may be associated with the reduction of the methamphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mglur5, and with a decrease in hyperthermia.";0;0;1;0

comparison of i.v. glycopyrrolate and atropine in the prevention of bradycardia and arrhythmias following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children.;the effectiveness of administration of glycopyrrolate 5 and 10 micrograms kg-1 and atropine 10 and 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. immediately before the induction of anaesthesia, to prevent arrhythmia and bradycardia following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children, was studied. a control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of glycopyrrolate and atropine. a frequency of bradycardia of 50% was noted in the control group, but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs. bradycardia (defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min-1) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used. it is recommended that either glycopyrrolate 10 micrograms kg-1 or atropine 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia, in children, if the repeated administration of suxamethonium is anticipated.;1;0;1;0

amino-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin show selective accumulation in striatal neurons and synaptic toxicity.;huntington disease ( hd ) is caused by expansion of a glutamine repeat in the amino-terminal region of huntingtin . despite its widespread expression , mutant huntingtin induces selective neuronal loss in striatal neurons . here we report that , in mutant mice expressing hd repeats , the production and aggregation of n-terminal huntingtin fragments preferentially occur in hd-affected neurons and their processes and axonal terminals . n-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin form aggregates and induce neuritic degeneration in cultured striatal neurons . n-terminal mutant huntingtin also binds to synaptic vesicles and inhibits their glutamate uptake in vitro . the specific processing and accumulation of toxic fragments of n-terminal huntingtin in hd-affected striatal neurons , especially in their neuronal processes and axonal terminals , may contribute to the selective neuropathology of hd . .;0;0;1;0

extrapyramidal side effects with risperidone and haloperidol at comparable d2 receptor occupancy levels.;"risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine d2 and serotonin 5-ht2 receptors. previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects; features shared by so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics. to determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of d2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [123i]ibzm spect to determine d2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone (n = 12) or haloperidol (n = 7). both risperidone and haloperidol produced d2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses. there was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone. drug-induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone (42%) and haloperidol (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%. based on these observations, it is concluded that 5-ht2 blockade obtained with risperidone at d2 occupancy rates of 60% and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects.";0;0;1;0

the association between tranexamic acid and convulsive seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariate analysis in 11 529 patients.;"because of a lack of contemporary data regarding seizures after cardiac surgery, we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11 529 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used from january 2004 to december 2010. a convulsive seizure was defined as a transient episode of disturbed brain function characterised by abnormal involuntary motor movements. multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative seizures. a total of 100 (0.9%) patients developed postoperative convulsive seizures. generalised and focal seizures were identified in 68 and 32 patients, respectively. the median (iqr [range]) time after surgery when the seizure occurred was 7 (6-12 [1-216]) h and 8 (6-11 [4-18]) h, respectively. epileptiform findings on electroencephalography were seen in 19 patients. independent predictors of postoperative seizures included age, female sex, redo cardiac surgery, calcification of ascending aorta, congestive heart failure, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, duration of aortic cross-clamp and tranexamic acid. when tested in a multivariate regression analysis, tranexamic acid was a strong independent predictor of seizures (or 14.3, 95% ci 5.5-36.7; p < 0.001). patients with convulsive seizures had 2.5 times higher in-hospital mortality rates and twice the length of hospital stay compared with patients without convulsive seizures. mean (iqr [range]) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 115 (49-228 [32-481]) h in patients with convulsive seizures compared with 26 (22-69 [14-1080]) h in patients without seizures (p < 0.001). convulsive seizures are a serious postoperative complication after cardiac surgery. as tranexamic acid is the only modifiable factor, its administration, particularly in doses exceeding 80 mg.kg(-1), should be weighed against the risk of postoperative seizures.";1;0;1;0

randomized, double-blind trial of mazindol in duchenne dystrophy.;"there is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in duchenne dystrophy. we conducted a 12-month controlled trial of mazindol, a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with duchenne dystrophy. muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol (3 mg/d) or placebo. the study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at p less than 0.05. mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study. side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite (36%), dry mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients. the effect of mazindol on gh secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive igf-i levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups. although mazindol-treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo-treated patients, no significant effect on igf-i levels was observed. mazindol doses not slow the progression of weakness in duchenne dystrophy.";0;0;1;0

oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage in adriamycin-induced cardiac mitochondrial injury.;the purpose of the present study was to determine if elevated reactive oxygen (ros)/nitrogen species (rns) reported to be present in adriamycin (adr)-induced cardiotoxicity actually resulted in cardiomyocyte oxidative/nitrative damage, and to quantitatively determine the time course and subcellular localization of these postulated damage products using an in vivo approach. b6c3 mice were treated with a single dose of 20 mg/kg adr. ultrastructural damage and levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4hne)-protein adducts and 3-nitrotyrosine (3nt) were analyzed. quantitative ultrastructural damage using computerized image techniques showed cardiomyocyte injury as early as 3 hours, with mitochondria being the most extensively and progressively injured subcellular organelle. analysis of 4hne protein adducts by immunogold electron microscopy showed appearance of 4hne protein adducts in mitochondria as early as 3 hours, with a peak at 6 hours and subsequent decline at 24 hours. 3nt levels were significantly increased in all subcellular compartments at 6 hours and subsequently declined at 24 hours. our data showed adr induced 4hne-protein adducts in mitochondria at the same time point as when mitochondrial injury initially appeared. these results document for the first time in vivo that mitochondrial oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage. the progressive nature of mitochondrial injury suggests that mitochondria, not other subcellular organelles, are the major site of intracellular injury.;1;0;0;0

antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of cibenzoline on canine ventricular arrhythmias.;using two-stage coronary ligation-, digitalis-, and adrenaline-induced canine ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic effects of cibenzoline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determined. cibenzoline suppressed all the arrhythmias, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, digitalis, and adrenaline were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- sdm, n = 6-7). the concentration for adrenaline-induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhythmias. this pharmacological profile is similar to those of mexiletine and tocainide, and all three drugs have central nervous system (cns) stimulant action. because cibenzoline had only weak hypotensive and sinus node depressive effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation arrhythmia dogs, its clinical usefulness is expected.;1;1;1;0

distribution of emerin and lamins in the heart and implications for emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy.;emerin is a nuclear membrane protein which is missing or defective in emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( edmd ) . it is one member of a family of lamina-associated proteins which includes lap1 , lap2 and lamin b receptor ( lbr ) . a panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) has been mapped to six specific sites throughout the emerin molecule using phage-displayed peptide libraries and has been used to localize emerin in human and rabbit heart . several mabs against different emerin epitopes did not recognize intercalated discs in the heart , though they recognized cardiomyocyte nuclei strongly , both at the rim and in intranuclear spots or channels . a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against emerin did recognize both nuclear membrane and intercalated discs but , after affinity purification against a pure-emerin band on a western blot , it stained only the nuclear membrane . these results would not be expected if immunostaining at intercalated discs were due to a product of the emerin gene and , therefore , cast some doubt upon the hypothesis that cardiac defects in edmd are caused by absence of emerin from intercalated discs . although emerin was abundant in the membranes of cardiomyocyte nuclei , it was absent from many non-myocyte cells in the heart . this distribution of emerin was similar to that of lamin a , a candidate gene for an autosomal form of edmd . in contrast , lamin b1 was absent from cardiomyocyte nuclei , showing that lamin b1 is not essential for localization of emerin to the nuclear lamina . lamin b1 is also almost completely absent from skeletal muscle nuclei . in edmd , the additional absence of lamin b1 from heart and skeletal muscle nuclei which already lack emerin may offer an alternative explanation of why these tissues are particularly affected . .;1;0;1;0

mice lacking mpges-1 are resistant to lithium-induced polyuria.;cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of lithium-induced polyuria. however, the involvement of a specific, terminal prostaglandin (pg) isomerase has not been evaluated. the present study was undertaken to assess lithium-induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin e synthase-1 (mpges-1). a 2-wk administration of licl (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mpges-1 +/+ mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine. this was associated with elevated renal mpges-1 protein expression and increased urine pge(2) excretion. in contrast, mpges-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to lithium-induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine pge(2) and camp output. immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative (q) rt-pcr consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin-2 (aqp2) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium-treated +/+ mice. this decrease was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice. qrt-pcr detected similar patterns of changes in aqp2 mrna in the medulla but not in the cortex. similarly, the total protein abundance of the na-k-2cl cotransporter (nkcc2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the +/+ mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment. in contrast, the dowregulation of renal medullary nkcc2 expression was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice. we conclude that mpges-1-derived pge(2) mediates lithium-induced polyuria likely via inhibition of aqp2 and nkcc2 expression.;0;1;0;0

safety and side-effects of alprazolam. controlled study in agoraphobia with panic disorder.;"background: the widespread use of benzodiazepines has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects. the efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic disorder with agoraphobia, and the side-effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured. method: in london and toronto 154 patients who met dsm-iii criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo. subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation. treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16. results: mean alprazolam dose was 5 mg daily. compared with placebo subjects, alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions (21% v. 0%) of depression, enuresis, disinhibition and aggression; and more side-effects, particularly sedation, irritability, impaired memory, weight loss and ataxia. side-effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8. despite this, the drop-out rate was low. conclusions: alprazolam caused side-effects and adverse effects during treatment but many patients were willing to accept these.";0;0;1;0

central excitatory actions of flurazepam.;toxic actions of flurazepam (fzp) were studied in cats, mice and rats. high doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic convulsions, superimposed on general depression. following a lethal dose, death was always associated with convulsions. comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions. signs of fzp toxocity in cats included excessive salivation, extreme apprehensive behavior, retching, muscle tremors and convulsions. an interaction between fzp and pentylenetetrazol (ptz) was shown by pretreating mice with fzp before ptz challenge. as a function of dose, fzp first protected against convulsions and death. at higher doses, however, convulsions again emerged. these doses of fzp were lower than those that would alone cause convulsions. these results may be relevant to the use of fzp in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability, such as epilepsy or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal.;0;0;1;0

restoration of photoreceptor ultrastructure and function in retinal degeneration slow mice by gene therapy.;the gene prph2 encodes a photoreceptor-specific membrane glycoprotein , peripherin-2 ( also known as peripherin / rds ) , which is inserted into the rims of photoreceptor outer segment discs in a complex with rom-1 ( ref . 2 ) . the complex is necessary for the stabilization of the discs , which are renewed constantly throughout life , and which contain the visual pigments necessary for photon capture . mutations in prph2 have been shown to result in a variety of photoreceptor dystrophies , including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and macular dystrophy . a common feature of these diseases is the loss of photoreceptor function , also seen in the retinal degeneration slow ( rds or prph2 rd2 / rd2 ) mouse , which is homozygous for a null mutation in prph2 . it is characterized by a complete failure to develop photoreceptor discs and outer segments , downregulation of rhodopsin and apoptotic loss of photoreceptor cells . the electroretinograms ( ergs ) of prph2rd2 / rd2 mice have greatly diminished a-wave and b-wave amplitudes , which decline to virtually undetectable concentrations by two months . subretinal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus ( aav ) encoding a prph2 transgene results in stable generation of outer segment structures and formation of new stacks of discs containing both perpherin-2 and rhodopsin , which in many cases are morphologically similar to normal outer segments . moreover , the re-establishment of the structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer also results in electrophysiological correction . these studies demonstrate for the first time that a complex ultrastructural cell defect can be corrected both morphologically and functionally by in vivo gene transfer . .;0;0;1;0

diuretics, potassium and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary disease.;it has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias. if this were so, patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible. thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium-conserving diuretic (amiloride) and a similar period on a potassium-losing diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a randomised study. plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol/l lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy. blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens. compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats (24-hour holter monitoring) and a higher lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation. the above results indicate that because potassium-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.;1;1;0;0
a novel, multiple symptom model of obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors in animals.;background: current animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) typically involve acute, drug-induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety. none of these current models demonstrate multiple ocd-like behaviors. methods: neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood. results: clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety (elevated plus maze and marble burying), behavioral inflexibility (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working memory impairment (e.g., win-shift paradigm), hoarding, and corticostriatal dysfunction. dopamine d2 receptors were elevated in the striatum, whereas serotonin 2c, but not serotonin 1a, receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex. conclusions: this is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an ocd-like profile in animals. moreover, these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to ocd. this novel model of ocd demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease-like systems permanently, which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders.;0;0;1;0
preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an american formulation of adenosine in humans.;background: preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation. the purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the us, using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity. methods: following food and drug administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg. cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined. results: adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h. in contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h). conclusions: these results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection. the long-lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid.;0;0;1;0

identification and localization of huntingtin in brain and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with anti-fusion protein antibodies.;the huntington disease ( hd ) phenotype is associated with expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the it15 gene , which is predicted to encode a 348-kda protein named huntington . we used polyclonal and monoclonal anti-fusion protein antibodies to identify native huntingtin in rat , monkey , and human . western blots revealed a protein with the expected molecular weight which is present in the soluble fraction of rat and monkey brain tissues and lymphoblastoid cells from control cases . in lymphoblastoid cell lines from juvenile-onset heterozygote hd cases , both normal and mutant huntingtin are expressed , and increasing repeat expansion leads to lower levels of the mutant protein . immunocytochemistry indicates that huntingtin is located in neurons throughout the brain , with the highest levels evident in larger neurons . in the human striatum , huntingtin is enriched in a patch-like distribution , potentially corresponding to the first areas affected in hd . subcellular localization of huntingtin is consistent with a cytosolic protein primarily found in somatodendritic regions . huntingtin appears to particularly associate with microtubules , although some is also associated with synaptic vesicles . on the basis of the localization of huntingtin in association with microtubules , we speculate that the mutation impairs the cytoskeletal anchoring or transport of mitochondria , vesicles , or other organelles or molecules . .;0;0;1;0

dysfunctional overnight memory consolidation in ecstasy users.;sleep plays an important role in the consolidation and integration of memory in a process called overnight memory consolidation. previous studies indicate that ecstasy users have marked and persistent neurocognitive and sleep-related impairments. we extend past research by examining overnight memory consolidation among regular ecstasy users (n=12) and drug naive healthy controls (n=26). memory recall of word pairs was evaluated before and after a period of sleep, with and without interference prior to testing. in addition, we assessed neurocognitive performances across tasks of learning, memory and executive functioning. ecstasy users demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation, a finding that was more pronounced following associative interference. additionally, ecstasy users demonstrated impairments on tasks recruiting frontostriatal and hippocampal neural circuitry, in the domains of proactive interference memory, long-term memory, encoding, working memory and complex planning. we suggest that ecstasy-associated dysfunction in fronto-temporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation memory impairments in regular ecstasy users.;0;0;1;0

glyburide-induced hepatitis.;drug-induced hepatotoxicity, although common, has been reported only infrequently with sulfonylureas. for glyburide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist. two patients with type ii diabetes mellitus developed an acute hepatitis-like syndrome soon after initiation of glyburide therapy. there was no serologic evidence of viral infection, and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with drug-induced hepatitis. both patients recovered quickly after stopping glyburide therapy and have remained well for a follow-up period of 1 year. glyburide can produce an acute hepatitis-like illness in some persons.;0;1;0;0
binasal visual field defects are not specific to vigabatrin.;this study investigated the visual defects associated with the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin (vgb). two hundred four people with epilepsy were grouped on the basis of antiepileptic drug therapy (current, previous, or no exposure to vgb). groups were matched with respect to age, gender, and seizure frequency. all patients underwent objective assessment of electrophysiological function (wide-field multifocal electroretinography) and conventional visual field testing (static perimetry). bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59% of patients currently taking vgb, 43% of patients who previously took vgb, and 24% of patients with no exposure to vgb. assessment of retinal function revealed abnormal responses in 48% of current vgb users and 22% of prior vgb users, but in none of the patients without previous exposure to vgb. bilateral visual field abnormalities are common in the treated epilepsy population, irrespective of drug history. assessment by conventional static perimetry may neither be sufficiently sensitive nor specific to reliably identify retinal toxicity associated with vgb.;0;0;1;0
functional consequences of mutations in the early growth response 2 gene (egr2) correlate with severity of human myelinopathies.;the early growth response 2 gene ( egr2 ) is a cys2his2zinc finger transcription factor which is thought to play a role in the regulation of peripheral nervous system myelination . this idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous krox20 ( egr2 ) knockout mice , which display hypomyelination of the pns and a block of schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation . mutations in the human egr2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited peripheral neuropathies charcot-marie-tooth type 1 , dejerine-sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy . three of the four egr2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger dna-binding domain . the fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain ( r1 ) that binds the nab transcriptional co-repressors . a combination of dna-binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations . the zinc finger mutations affect dna binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity . the r1 domain mutation prevents interaction of egr2 with the nab co-repressors and thereby increases transcriptional activity . these data provide insight into the possible disease mechanisms underlying egr2 mutations and the reason for varying severity and differences in inheritance patterns . .;0;0;1;0
spontaneous reversion of novel lesch-nyhan mutation by hprt gene rearrangement.;molecular analysis of an unusual patient with the lesch-nyhan syndrome has suggested that the mutation is due to a partial hprt gene duplication . we now report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant hprt cdna which shows the precise duplication of exons 2 and 3 . this mutation is the result of an internal duplication of 16-20 kilobases of the gene . the structure of the mutant gene suggests that the duplication was not generated by a single unequal crossing-over event between two normal hprt alleles . growth of epstein-barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from this patient in selective medium has permitted isolation of spontaneous hprt + revertants of this mutation . the reversion event involves a second major hprt gene rearrangement where most or all of the duplicated portion of the mutant gene is deleted . the original mutation therefore has the potential for spontaneous somatic reversion . this may explain the relatively mild symptoms of the lesch-nyhan syndrome exhibited by this patient . .;0;0;1;0

evidence for cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors in man.;"we compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg atenolol (cardioselective), 40 mg propranolol (nonselective), and placebo on both exercise- and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in two experiments involving nine normal subjects. maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 +/- 4(sem) after placebo to 146 +/- 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 +/- 6 bpm after propranolol, but there were no differences between the drugs. the effects on isoproterenol tachycardia were determined before and after atropine (0.04 mg/kg iv). isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm (cd25) and this was increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 +/- 8.3 micrograms after propranolol and 8.3 +/- 1.7 micrograms after atenolol. the difference in the effects of the two was significant. after atropine the cd25 was unchanged after placebo (2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms) and atenolol (7.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms); it was reduced after propranolol (24.8 +/- 5.0 micrograms), but remained different from atenolol. this change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent ka, this was unchanged by atropine (11.7 +/- 2.1 and 10.1 +/- 2.5 ml/ng). these data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug. while there appear to be beta 2-receptors in the human heart, their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined.";1;0;1;0

nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive bladder.;purpose: ngf and pgs in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine. we investigated changes in urinary ngf and pgs in women with oab. materials and methods: the study groups included 65 women with oab and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls. evaluation included patient history, urinalysis, a voiding diary and urodynamic studies. urine samples were collected. ngf, pge2, pgf2alpha and pgi2 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups. in addition, correlations between urinary ngf and pg, and urodynamic parameters in patients with oab were examined. results: urinary ngf, pge2 and pgf2alpha were significantly increased in patients with oab compared with controls (p <0.05). however, urinary pgi2 was not different between controls and patients with oab. in patients with oab urinary pge2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). urinary ngf, pgf2alpha and pgi2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with oab. conclusions: ngf and pgs have important roles in the development of oab symptoms in female patients. urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate oab symptoms.;0;0;1;0

auditory disturbance associated with interscalene brachial plexus block.;"we performed an audiometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an interscalene brachial plexus block (ibpb). bupivacaine 0.75% with adrenaline was given followed by a 24-hr continuous infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine. three audiometric threshold measurements (0.25-18 khz) were made: the first before ibpb, the second 2-6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation. in four patients hearing impairment on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation, in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day. the frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients; in one only low frequencies (0.25-0.5 khz) were involved. the maximum change in threshold was 35 db at 6 khz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of bupivacaine. this patient had hearing threshold changes (15-20 db) at 6-10 khz on the opposite side also. ibpb may cause transient auditory dysfunction in the ipsilateral ear, possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation.";0;1;0;0
clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral prostacyclin analogue beraprost and phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol.;"among various oral antiplatelets, a combination of a novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost (bpt) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol (clz) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular camp (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate). thereby, a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted. twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take bpt/clz in the following schedule; bpt: 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t.i.d. from day 7 to 14, clz: 200 mg t.i.d. from day 3 to 14. at various time intervals, physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet camp were performed. throughout the observation period, no significant alteration in vital signs was observed. seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one, especially after ingestion of clz. all of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required. intraplatelet camp content was gradually but significantly increased to 9.84 +/- 4.59 pmol per 10(9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value (6.87 +/- 2.25 pmol). the platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted. in conclusion, the combined administration of bpt/clz is safe at doses used in the study, though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated.";0;0;1;0

alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial block induced by propranolol.;alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial (s-a) block was observed in a 57-year-old woman, under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol daily. the electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short p-p intervals and occasional pauses. these pauses were always preceded by the short p-p intervals and were usually followed by one or two p-p intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle. following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer p-p interval. the long p-p intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short p-p intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively. the duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long p-p interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle. in one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 s-a block was observed. this short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the p-p interval starting the alternative rhythm. there were small changes in the shape of the p waves and p-r intervals. s-a conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating p-p interval and other electrocardiographic features seen. atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all p-p intervals without changing the rhythm. the abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 s-a block was seen. this was accepted as evidence for propranolol being the cause of this conduction disorder.;1;0;0;0

repeated transient anuria following losartan administration in a patient with a solitary kidney.;we report the case of a 70-year-old hypertensive man with a solitary kidney and chronic renal insufficiency who developed two episodes of transient anuria after losartan administration. he was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, treated with high-dose diuretics. due to severe systolic dysfunction losartan was prescribed. surprisingly, the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria, which lasted eight hours despite high-dose furosemide and amine infusion. one week later, by mistake, losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg, the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting 10 hours. during these two episodes, his blood pressure diminished but no severe hypotension was noted. ultimately, an arteriography showed a 70-80% renal artery stenosis. in this patient, renal artery stenosis combined with heart failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin-angiotensin system (ras). under such conditions, angiotensin ii receptor blockade by losartan probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure. this case report highlights the fact that the angiotensin ii receptor antagonist losartan can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with renovascular disease and should be used with extreme caution in this setting.;1;1;0;0

evaluation of the anticocaine monoclonal antibody gnc92h2 as an immunotherapy for cocaine overdose.;the illicit use of cocaine continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for cocaine overdose remains elusive. current protein-based technology offers a new therapeutic venue by which antibodies bind the drug in the blood stream, inactivating its toxic effects. the therapeutic potential of the anticocaine antibody gnc92h2 was examined using a model of cocaine overdose. swiss albino mice prepared with intrajugular catheters were tested in photocell cages after administration of 93 mg/kg (ld50) of cocaine and gnc92h2 infusions ranging from 30 to 190 mg/kg. gnc92h2 was delivered 30 min before, concomitantly or 3 min after cocaine treatment. significant blockade of cocaine toxicity was observed with the higher dose of gnc92h2 (190 mg/kg), where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40%, seizures up to 77% and death by 72%. importantly, gnc92h2 prevented death even post-cocaine injection. the results support the important potential of gnc92h2 as a therapeutic tool against cocaine overdose.;0;1;1;0
a 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results in a kinetic variant of phenylketonuria.;phenylketonuria ( pku ) is an autosomal recessive disease due to deficiency of a hepatic enzyme , phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) . the absence of pah activity results in typical pku while persistence of a residual enzyme activity gives rise to variant forms of the disease . we report here a 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the pah gene ( delta 194 ) in a mild variant , with markedly reduced affinity of the enzyme for phenylalanine ( km = 160 nm ) , and we provide functional evidence for responsibility of the deletion in the mutant phenotype . since the deletion was located in the third exon of the gene , which presents no homology with other hydroxylases , we suggest that exon 3 is involved in the specificity of the enzyme for phenylalanine . finally , since none of the 98 pku patients tested were found to carry this particular deletion , our study suggests that this molecular event probably occurred recently on the background of a haplotype 2 gene in portugal . .;0;1;1;0
pten, a putative protein tyrosine phosphatase gene mutated in human brain, breast, and prostate cancer.;mapping of homozygous deletions on human chromosome 10q23 has led to the isolation of a candidate tumor suppressor gene , pten , that appears to be mutated at considerable frequency in human cancers . in preliminary screens , mutations of pten were detected in 31 % ( 13 / 42 ) of glioblastoma cell lines and xenografts , 100 % ( 4 / 4 ) of prostate cancer cell lines , 6 % ( 4 / 65 ) of breast cancer cell lines and xenografts , and 17 % ( 3 / 18 ) of primary glioblastomas . the predicted pten product has a protein tyrosine phosphatase domain and extensive homology to tensin , a protein that interacts with actin filaments at focal adhesions . these homologies suggest that pten may suppress tumor cell growth by antagonizing protein tyrosine kinases and may regulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis through interactions at focal adhesions . .;0;0;0;1

hypersensitivity myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart.;the present report describes a case of eosinophilic myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. the 47-year-old female patient, known to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was admitted with biventricular failure and managed aggressively with dobutamine infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation. on transthoracic echocardiogram, she had moderate left ventricular dysfunction with regional variability and moderate mitral regurgitation. the recipient's heart showed the features of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis with abundant eosinophils. myocarditis is rare and eosinophilic myocarditis is rarer. it is likely that the hypersensitivity (eosinophilic) myocarditis was related to dobutamine infusion therapy. eosinophilic myocarditis has been reported with an incidence of 2.4% to 7.2% in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy.;1;0;0;0
cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen, adriamycin, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and galactosamine.;in addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, cholesteryl hemisuccinate, tris salt (cs) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride (ccl4). to further our understanding of the mechanism of cs cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of cs and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of cs, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (cse) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, chloroform- and galactosamine-induced toxicity. the results of these studies demonstrated that cs-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical. a 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of cs (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of ccl4, chcl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration. maximal cs-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult. these data suggest that cs intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death. the mechanism of cs protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity). however, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that cs administration inhibits chemical bioactivation. our findings do suggest that cs-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic cs molecule (non-hydrolyzable cse was as protective as cs), whose mechanism has yet to be defined.;1;0;0;0
conversion to rapamycin immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients: report of an initial experience.;background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of rapa conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine (csa) or tacrolimus (tac) toxicity. methods: twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin (rapa) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses. the indications for switch were chronic csa or tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute csa or tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (ptld) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1. follow-up is 7 to 24 months. results: in the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [233+/-34 to 210+/-56 micromol/liter (p<0.05) at 6 months]. facial dysmorphism improved in two patients. no relapse of ptld was observed. five patients developed pneumonia (two pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal ptld lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans. there were no deaths. rapa was discontinued in four patients, because of pneumonia in two, ptld in one, and oral aphtous ulcers in one. rapa levels were high (>15 ng/ml) in 7 of 13 (54%) patients. conclusions: rapa conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable csa withdrawal. however, when converting patients to rapa drug levels should be monitored to avoid over-immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given.;0;1;0;0

hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone and amiodarone in animals with a healed myocardial infarction.;the hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone, a noniodinated compound structurally related to amiodarone, were compared with those of amiodarone after prolonged oral administration, both at rest and during sympathetic stimulation in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction. all dogs (n = 6) randomly received orally dronedarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), amiodarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), and placebo twice daily for 7 days, with a 3-week washout between consecutive treatments. heart rate (hr), mean arterial pressure (mbp), positive rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (+lvdp/dt), echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef), and fractional shortening (fs), as well as chronotropic response to isoproterenol and exercise-induced sympathetic stimulation were evaluated under baseline and posttreatment conditions. resting values of lvef, fs, +lvdp/dt, and mbp remained unchanged whatever the drug and the dosing regimen, whereas resting hr was significantly and dose-dependently lowered after dronedarone and to a lesser extent after amiodarone. both dronedarone and amiodarone significantly reduced the exercise-induced tachycardia and, at the highest dose, decreased the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. thus, dronedarone and amiodarone displayed a similar level of antiadrenergic effect and did not impair the resting left ventricular function. consequently, dronedarone might be particularly suitable for the treatment and prevention of various clinical arrhythmias, without compromising the left ventricular function.;1;0;0;0

effect of alpha-tocopherol and deferoxamine on methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.;methamphetamine (ma)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals. this study examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-tc), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and deferoxamine (dfo), an iron chelator, on the ma-induced neurotoxicity. male rats were treated with ma (10 mg/kg, every 2 h for four injections). the rat received either alpha-tc (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to ma administration or dfo (50 mg/kg) subcutaneously 30 min before ma administration. the concentrations of dopamine (da), serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after ma administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-tc and dfo pretreatment. alpha-tc and dfo attenuated the ma-induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity. the level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the ma-treated rats. these changes were significantly attenuated by alpha-tc and dfo. this suggests that alpha-tc and dfo ameliorate the ma-induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative stress.;0;0;1;0

glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by nmda receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol-induced catalepsy.;the inferior colliculus (ic) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system. functional evidence relating the ic to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the ic by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility. however, the nature of this immobility is still unclear. the present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the ic on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats. haloperidol-induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate nmda receptor antagonists, mk-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and ap7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the nmda receptor agonist n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl). the results showed that intracollicular microinjection of mk-801 and ap7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar. accordingly, intracollicular microinjection of nmda increased the latency to step down the bar. these findings suggest that glutamate-mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the ic level influence haloperidol-induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity.;0;0;1;0

reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen.;"a patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over-the-counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate, caffeine, and acetaminophen displayed no significant cns stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per ml of serum. because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the cns, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen (52 micrograms/ml) reduced the cns toxicity of caffeine. studies in dba/2j mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with acetaminophen (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine (300 to 450 mg/kg ip) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with acetaminophen (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine (12.5 to 75 mg/kg ip). the frequency of sound-induced seizures after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5% by acetaminophen. in the absence of caffeine, acetaminophen (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice (tests performed by the anticonvulsant screening project of nincds). acetaminophen (up to 150 micrograms/ml) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive adenosine into atp in slices of rat cerebral cortex. thus the mechanism by which acetaminophen antagonizes the actions of caffeine in the cns remains unknown.";0;0;1;0
constitutive and regulated modes of splicing produce six major myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (dmpk) isoforms with distinct properties.;myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) is the most prevalent inherited neuromuscular disease in adults . the genetic defect is a ctg triplet repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( dmpk ) gene , consisting of 15 exons . using a transgenic dmpk-overexpressor mouse model , we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse dmpk gene and the human dmpk transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mrnas which have almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns . use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8 , which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a vsggg peptide motif , and / or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14 , which leads to a frameshift in the mrna reading frame , occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined . in contrast , the excision of exons 13 / 14 that causes a frameshift and creates a c-terminally truncated protein is clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle . we generated all six full-length mouse cdnas that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kda full-length ( heart- , skeletal muscle- or brain-specific ) and two c-terminally truncated approximately 68 kda ( smooth muscle-specific ) isoforms . information on dmpk mrna and protein isoform expression patterns will be useful for recognizing differential effects of ( ctg ) ( n ) expansion in dm manifestation . .;1;0;1;0

liposomal daunorubicin in advanced kaposi's sarcoma: a phase ii study.;we report a non-randomized phase ii clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal daunorubicin (daunoxome) in the treatment of aids related kaposi's sarcoma. eleven homosexual men with advanced kaposi's sarcoma were entered in the trial. changes in size, colour and associated oedema of selected 'target' lesions were measured. clinical, biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed. ten subjects were evaluated. a partial response was achieved in four, of whom two subsequently relapsed. stabilization of kaposi's sarcoma occurred in the remaining six, maintained until the end of the trial period in four. the drug was generally well tolerated, with few mild symptoms of toxicity. the main problem encountered was haematological toxicity, with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l). there was no evidence of cardiotoxicity. in this small patient sample, liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of kaposi's sarcoma.;1;0;1;1

contrast medium nephrotoxicity after renal artery and coronary angioplasty.;background: renal dysfunction induced by iodinated contrast medium (cm) administration can minimize the benefit of the interventional procedure in patients undergoing renal angioplasty (ptra). purpose: to compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of cm in patients undergoing ptra with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). material and methods: a total of 33 patients successfully treated with ptra (ptra group, mean age 70+/-12 years, 23 female, basal creatinine 1.46+/-0.79, range 0.7-4.9 mg/dl) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful pci (pci group), matched for basal creatinine (1.44+/-0.6, range 0.7-3.4 mg/dl), gender, and age. in both groups postprocedural (48 h) serum creatinine was measured. results: postprocedural creatinine level decreased nonsignificantly in the ptra group (1.46+/-0.8 vs. 1.34+/-0.5 mg/dl, p=ns) and increased significantly in the pci group (1.44+/-0.6 vs. 1.57+/-0.7 mg/dl, p<0.02). changes in serum creatinine after intervention (after-before) were significantly different between the ptra and pci groups (-0.12+/-0.5 vs. 0.13+/-0.3, p=0.014). this difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of cm administered. conclusion: in this preliminary study patients submitted to ptra showed a lower susceptibility to renal damage induced by cm administration than pci patients. the effectiveness of ptra on renal function seems to be barely influenced by cm toxicity.;1;1;1;0

genetic heterogeneity in hereditary breast cancer: role of brca1 and brca2.;the common hereditary forms of breast cancer have been largely attributed to the inheritance of mutations in the brca1 or brca2 genes . however , it is not yet clear what proportion of hereditary breast cancer is explained by brca1 and brca2 or by some other unidentified susceptibility gene ( s ) . we describe the proportion of hereditary breast cancer explained by brca1 or brca2 in a sample of north american hereditary breast cancers and assess the evidence for additional susceptibility genes that may confer hereditary breast or ovarian cancer risk . twenty-three families were identified through two high-risk breast cancer research programs . genetic analysis was undertaken to establish linkage between the breast or ovarian cancer cases and markers on chromosomes 17q ( brca1 ) and 13q ( brca2 ) . mutation analysis in the brca1 and brca2 genes was also undertaken in all families . the pattern of hereditary cancer in 14 ( 61 % ) of the 23 families studied was attributed to brca1 by a combination of linkage and mutation analyses . no families were attributed to brca2 . five families ( 22 % ) provided evidence against linkage to both brca1 and brca2 . no brca1 or brca2 mutations were detected in these five families . the brca1 or brca2 status of four families ( 17 % ) could not be determined . brca1 and brca2 probably explain the majority of hereditary breast cancer that exists in the north american population . however , one or more additional genes may yet be found that explain some proportion of hereditary breast cancer . .;0;0;1;1
reversal of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy by novel aryl-piperazine anxiolytic drugs.;the novel anxiolytic drug, buspirone, reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol. a series of aryl-piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5-hydroxytryptaminergic agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy. those drugs with strong affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy. drugs with affinity for other 5-ht receptors or weak affinity were ineffective. however, inhibition of postsynaptic 5-ht receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect.;0;0;1;0
"delayed asystolic cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose; resuscitation with high dose intravenous calcium.";a 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1.8-3.6 g of diltiazem, paracetamol, aspirin, isosorbide nitrate, and alcohol. he initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids. eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic-clonic seizures. the patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became asystolic. he was resuscitated with high dose (13.5 g) intravenous calcium and adrenaline (epinephrine). he required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours. this case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose, particularly with the onset of asystole. it should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose. the case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered.;1;1;1;0

animal model of mania induced by ouabain: evidence of oxidative stress in submitochondrial particles of the rat brain.;the intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of ouabain (a na(+)/k(+)-atpase inhibitor) in rats has been suggested to mimic some symptoms of human bipolar mania. clinical studies have shown that bipolar disorder may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction. herein, we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects induced by the icv administration of ouabain in rats. to achieve this aim, the effects of ouabain injection immediately after and 7 days following a single icv administration (at concentrations of 10(-2) and 10(-3)m) on locomotion was measured using the open-field test. additionally, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (tbarss) and superoxide production were measured in submitochondrial particles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala. our findings demonstrated that ouabain at 10(-2) and 10(-3)m induced hyperlocomotion in rats, and this response remained up to 7 days following a single icv injection. in addition, we observed that the persistent increase in the rat spontaneous locomotion is associated with increased tbars levels and superoxide generation in submitochondrial particles in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and amygdala. in conclusion, ouabain-induced mania-like behavior may provide a useful animal model to test the hypothesis of the involvement of oxidative stress in bipolar disorder.;0;0;1;0
a mouse model for prader-willi syndrome imprinting-centre mutations.;imprinting in the 15q11-q13 region involves an imprinting centre ( ic ) , mapping in part to the promoter and first exon of snrpn . deletion of this ic abolishes local paternally derived gene expression and results in prader-willi syndrome ( pws ) . we have created two deletion mutations in mice to understand pws and the mechanism of this ic . mice harbouring an intragenic deletion in snrpn are phenotypically normal , suggesting that mutations of snrpn are not sufficient to induce pws . mice with a larger deletion involving both snrpn and the putative pws-ic lack expression of the imprinted genes zfp127 ( mouse homologue of znf127 ) , ndn and ipw , and manifest several phenotypes common to pws infants . these data demonstrate that both the position of the ic and its role in the coordinate expression of genes is conserved between mouse and human , and indicate that the mouse is a suitable model system in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms of imprinting in this region of the genome . .;0;0;1;0

halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross-react with halothane-induced antibodies.;two halogenated anesthetics, enflurane and isoflurane, have been associated with an allergic-type hepatic injury both alone and following previous exposure to halothane. halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response. an antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (trifluoroacetyl adduct) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients. this study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane. the subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane-induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models. enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver. in the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats. this supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and/or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration. the guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens.;0;1;0;0
epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats.;background: fibrin sealants (fs) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery. in order to increase clot stability, fs typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid (tamca) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. however, tamca has been shown to cause epileptic seizures. we wanted to study whether tamca retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a fs. method: fs containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tamca (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. the response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia. findings: fs containing tamca caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours. the degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tamca. thus, fs containing 47.5 mg/ml tamca evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of tamca (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats. in contrast, fs containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity. interpretation: tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within fs. thus, use of fs containing tamca for surgery within or close to the cns may pose a substantial risk to the patient.;0;0;1;0

identification of wasp mutations, mutation hotspots and genotype-phenotype disparities in 24 patients with the wiskott-aldrich syndrome.;the wiskott-aldrich syndrome ( was ) , an x-linked immunodeficiency disease caused by mutation in the recently isolated gene encoding was protein ( wasp ) , is known to be associated with extensive clinical heterogeneity . cumulative mutation data have revealed that wasp genotypes are also highly variable among was patients , but the relationship of phenotype with genotype in this disease remains unclear . to address this issue we characterized wasp mutations in 24 unrelated was patients , including 18 boys with severe classical was and 6 boys expressing mild forms of the disease , and then examined the degree of correlation of these as well as all previously published wasp mutations with disease severity . by analysis of these compiled mutation data , we demonstrated clustering of wasp mutations within the four most n-terminal exons of the gene and also identified several sites within this region as hotspots for wasp mutation . these characteristics were observed , however , in both severe and mild cases of the disease . similarly , while the cumulative data revealed a predominance of missense mutations among the wasp gene lesions observed in boys with isolated thrombocytopenia , missense mutations were not exclusively associated with milder was phenotypes , but also comprised a substantial portion ( 38 % ) of the wasp gene defects found in patients with severe disease . these findings , as well as the detection of identical wasp mutations in patients with disparate phenotypes , reveal a lack of phenotype concordance with genotype in was and thus imply that phenotypic outcome in this disease cannot be reliably predicted solely on the basis of wasp genotypes . .;0;0;1;0
efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in 3390 women with moderate hypercholesterolemia.;"objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in women with moderate hypercholesterolemia. design: the expanded clinical evaluation of lovastatin (excel) study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. setting: ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the united states. patients: women (n = 3390) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers. measurements: plasma total, low-density lipoprotein (ldl), and high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study. results: among women, lovastatin (20 to 80 mg/d) produced sustained (12- to 48-week), dose-related changes (p < 0.001): decreases in ldl cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglycerides (9% to 18%), and increases in hdl cholesterol (6.7% to 8.6%). depending on the dose, from 82% to 95% of lovastatin-treated women achieved the national cholesterol education program goal of ldl cholesterol levels less than 4.14 mmol/l (160 mg/dl), and 40% to 87% achieved the goal of 3.36 mmol/l (130 mg/dl). successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.1% of women and were dose dependent above the 20-mg dose. myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of lovastatin (80 mg). estrogen-replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of lovastatin. conclusion: lovastatin is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary hypercholesterolemia in women.";0;1;1;0

effects of active constituents of crocus sativus l., crocin on streptozocin-induced model of sporadic alzheimer's disease in male rats.;"background: the involvement of water-soluble carotenoids, crocins, as the main and active components of crocus sativus l. extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed. in the present study, the effect of crocins on sporadic alzheimer's disease induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (stz) in male rats was investigated. methods: male adult wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, stz; 5 and 6, stz + crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups. in alzheimer's disease groups, rats were injected with stz-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar stz-icv application was repeated. in stz + crocin animal groups, crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks. prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days. however, the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm, and for spatial cognition evaluation, y-maze task was used. results: it was found out that crocin (30 mg/kg)-treated stz-injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in y-maze than vehicle-treated stz-injected rats. in addition, crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated stz-injected group in passive avoidance test. conclusion: therefore, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of crocin (30 mg/kg) in antagonizing the cognitive deficits caused by stz-icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's disease.";0;0;1;0
optimal precurarizing dose of rocuronium to decrease fasciculation and myalgia following succinylcholine administration.;background: succinylcholine commonly produces frequent adverse effects, including muscle fasciculation and myalgia. the current study identified the optimal dose of rocuronium to prevent succinylcholine-induced fasciculation and myalgia and evaluated the influence of rocuronium on the speed of onset produced by succinylcholine. methods: this randomized, double-blinded study was conducted in 100 patients randomly allocated into five groups of 20 patients each. patients were randomized to receive 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 mg/kg rocuronium as a precurarizing dose. neuromuscular monitoring after each precurarizing dose was recorded from the adductor pollicis muscle using acceleromyography with train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. all patients received succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg at 2 minutes after the precurarization, and were assessed the incidence and severity of fasciculations, while myalgia was assessed at 24 hours after surgery. results: the incidence and severity of visible muscle fasciculation was significantly less with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium (p < 0.001). those of myalgia tend to decrease according to increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium, but there was no significance (p = 0.072). the onset time of succinylcholine was significantly longer with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium (p < 0.001). conclusions: precurarization with 0.04 mg/kg rocuronium was the optimal dose considering the reduction in the incidence and severity of fasciculation and myalgia with acceptable onset time, and the safe and effective precurarization.;0;0;1;0
sirolimus-associated proteinuria and renal dysfunction.;sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor-containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase. sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, autoimmunity, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation. because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'. however, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction. a common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing chronic renal damage. the mechanisms of sirolimus-associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. it has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. the acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed. further long-term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future.;0;1;1;1
ifosfamide related encephalopathy: the need for a timely eeg evaluation.;"background: ifosfamide is an alkylating agent useful in the treatment of a wide range of cancers including sarcomas, lymphoma, gynecologic and testicular cancers. encephalopathy has been reported in 10-40% of patients receiving high-dose iv ifosfamide. objective: to highlight the role of electroencephalogram (eeg) in the early detection and management of ifosfamide related encephalopathy. methods: retrospective chart review including clinical data and eeg recordings was done on five patients, admitted to md anderson cancer center between years 2009 and 2012, who developed ifosfamide related acute encephalopathy. results: all five patients experienced symptoms of encephalopathy soon after (within 12 h-2 days) receiving ifosfamide. two patients developed generalized convulsions while one patient developed continuous non-convulsive status epilepticus (ncse) that required icu admission and intubation. initial eeg showed epileptiform discharges in three patients; run of triphasic waves in one patient and moderate degree diffuse generalized slowing. mixed pattern with the presence of both sharps and triphasic waves were also noted. repeat eegs within 24_h of symptom onset showed marked improvement that was correlated with clinical improvement. conclusions: severity of ifosfamide related encephalopathy correlates with eeg changes. we suggest a timely eeg evaluation for patients receiving ifosfamide who develop features of encephalopathy.";0;0;1;1
acute psychosis due to treatment with phenytoin in a nonepileptic patient.;the development of psychosis related to antiepileptic drug treatment is usually attributed to the interaction between the epileptic brain substratum and the antiepileptic drugs. the case of a nonepileptic patient who developed psychosis following phenytoin treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is described. this case suggests that the psychotic symptoms that occur following phenytoin treatment in some epileptic patients may be the direct result of medication, unrelated to seizures.;0;0;1;0
a japanese family with adrenoleukodystrophy with a codon 291 deletion: a clinical, biochemical, pathological, and genetic report.;we report a japanese family with adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) with a three base pair deletion ( delgag 291 ) in the ald gene . a variety of phenotypes were observed within this family . while the proband ( patient 1 ) was classified as having a rare intermediate type of adult cerebral and cerebello-brain stem forms , his younger brother ( patient 2 ) and nephew ( patient 3 ) had a childhood ald type . another nephew ( patient 4 ) of patient 1 was classified as having an adolescent form . the tau level in the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) in patient 1 was as high as that of patients with alzheimers disease ( ad ) . his brain magnetic resonance image ( mri ) showed abnormalities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and brain stem , but not in the cerebral white matter , where marked reductions of the cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism were clearly demonstrated by positron emission tomography ( pet ) . in patients 2 and 3 , the autopsy findings showed massive demyelination of the cerebral white matter with sparing of the u-fibers , compatible with the findings of childhood ald . oleic and erucic acids ( lorenzos oil ) were administered to patients 1 and 4 , but sufficient effectiveness was not obtained . the findings in this family suggest that delgag291 is part of the cause of japanese ald with phenotypic variations . moreover , although the scale of the study is limited , there is a possibility that pet can detect an insidious lesion which is undetectable by computed tomogram ( ct ) or mri analysis , and that the higher level of tau reflects the process of neuronal degeneration in ald . lorenzos oil should be given in the early stage . .;0;0;1;0

neural correlates of s-ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency.;the glutamatergic n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive nmda receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. in patients with schizophrenia, ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. in a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic s-ketamine infusion while differences in bold responses measured with fmri were detected. during the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic). ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the positive and negative syndrome scale (panss). ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology. post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions. our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an nmda receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.;0;0;1;0

mutations of the vhl gene in sporadic renal cell carcinoma: definition of a risk factor for vhl patients to develop an rcc.;to investigate the nature of somatic von hippel-lindau ( vhl ) mutations , we analyzed 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas for mutations of the vhl tumor suppressor gene , using polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis ( sscp ) of dna . we detected abnormal sscp pattern in 73 samples . after sequencing , we identified microdeletions in 58 % of cases , microinsertions in 17 % , nonsense mutations in 8 % , and missense mutations in 17 % . among these mutations , 50 % correspond to new mutations . vhl mutations were found only in the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) subtype , as previously reported . to compare somatic and germline mutations , we used the vhl database , which includes 507 mutations . the study of mutational events revealed a significant difference between somatic and germline mutations with mutations leading to truncated proteins observed in 78 % of somatic mutations vs only 37 % in germline mutations ( p vhl mutations is associated with sporadic rcc . this pattern corresponds to mutations leading mainly to truncated proteins with few specific missense mutations . we then analyzed the occurrence of rcc in vhl families , based on the nature of mutations . we observed rcc in at least one member of the vhl families in 77 % of cases with mutations leading to truncated proteins versus 55 % in cases with missense mutations ( p rcc in vhl patients;0;1;0;1
time dependence of plasma malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides during incomplete cerebral ischemia in the rat.;"incomplete cerebral ischemia (30 min) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries. peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times (once every 5 min) before ischemia (0 time) and 5, 15, and 30 min after ischemia. plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides. during ischemia, a time-dependent increase of plasma oxypurines and nucleosides was observed. plasma malondialdehyde, which was present in minimal amount at zero time (0.058 mumol/liter plasma; sd 0.015), increased after 5 min of ischemia, resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion (0.298 mumol/liter plasma; sd 0.078). increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia, the other receiving 650 micrograms/kg b.w. of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during ischemia, although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly higher. the present data indicate that the determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides in peripheral blood, may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena.(abstract truncated at 250 words)";0;0;1;0

adenomatous polyposis coli and a cytogenetic deletion of chromosome 5 resulting from a maternal intrachromosomal insertion.;we present the clinical and laboratory findings in an institutionalised adult patient originally referred for autism . a high risk of colorectal cancer was predicted when an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 , del ( 5 ) ( q15q22 . 3 ) , was detected in her lymphocytes and deletion of the mcc and apc genes confirmed by molecular analysis . adenomatous polyposis coli and carcinoma of the rectum were subsequently diagnosed in the patient . she was profoundly mentally retarded , autistic , and had minor dysmorphic features consistent with those of previous patients with similar deletions . the deletion arose as a result of recombination within the small insertion loop formed at meiosis by the direct insertion ( dir ins ( 5 ) ( q22 . 3q14 . 2q15 ) ) found in the patients mother . this family further confirms the cytogenetic mapping of both mcc and apc genes to 5q22 and comparison with other recent cases suggests that both genes and their closely linked markers lie within the 5q22 . 1 subband;0;0;1;1
repeated trimipramine induces dopamine d2/d3 and alpha1-adrenergic up-regulation.;trimipramine (tri), which shows a clinical antidepressant activity, is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, nor does it induce beta-adrenergic down-regulation. the mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown. the aim of the present study was to find out whether tri given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants. tri was given to male wistar rats and male albino swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days. in the acute experiment tri (given i.p.) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5-hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats. tri given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d-amphetamine, quinpirole and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (dopamine d2 and d3 effects). the stereotypies induced by d-amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by tri. it increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor. it may be concluded that, like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously, tri given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine d2 and d3 (locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors to their agonists. a question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants, suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity.;0;1;1;0

in vivo evidences suggesting the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity: protection by erdosteine.;the aims of this study were to examine vancomycin (vcm)-induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and to investigate the role of erdosteine, an expectorant agent, which has also antioxidant properties, on kidney tissue against the possible vcm-induced renal impairment in rats. rats were divided into three groups: sham, vcm and vcm plus erdosteine. vcm was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 200mgkg(-1) twice daily for 7 days. erdosteine was administered orally. vcm administration to control rats significantly increased renal malondialdehyde (mda) and urinary n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nag, a marker of renal tubular injury) excretion but decreased superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase (cat) activities. erdosteine administration with vcm injections caused significantly decreased renal mda and urinary nag excretion, and increased sod activity, but not cat activity in renal tissue when compared with vcm alone. erdosteine showed histopathological protection against vcm-induced nephrotoxicity. there were a significant dilatation of tubular lumens, extensive epithelial cell vacuolization, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in vcm-treated rats more than those of the control and the erdosteine groups. erdosteine caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage. it is concluded that oxidative tubular damage plays an important role in the vcm-induced nephrotoxicity and the modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine reduces the vcm-induced kidney damage both at the biochemical and histological levels.;0;1;1;0

atm and bax cooperate in ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in the central nervous system.;ataxia-telangiectasia is a hereditary multisystemic disease resulting from mutations of ataxia telangiectasia , mutated ( atm ) and is characterized by neurodegeneration , cancer , immune defects , and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation . the molecular details of atm function in the nervous system are unclear , although the neurological lesion in ataxia-telangiectasia becomes apparent early in life , suggesting a developmental origin . the central nervous system ( cns ) of atm-null mice shows a pronounced defect in apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress , suggesting atm functions to eliminate neurons with excessive genomic damage . here , we report that the death effector bax is required for a large proportion of atm-dependent apoptosis in the developing cns after ionizing radiation ( ir ) . although many of the same regions of the cns in both bax- / - and atm- / - mice were radioresistant , mice nullizygous for both bax and atm showed additional reduction in ir-induced apoptosis in the cns . therefore , although the major ir-induced apoptotic pathway in the cns requires atm and bax , a p53-dependent collateral pathway exists that has both atm- and bax-independent branches . further , atm- and bax-dependent apoptosis in the cns also required caspase-3 activation . these data implicate bax and caspase-3 as death effectors in neurodegenerative pathways . .;0;0;1;1
recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (cb 3717).;cb 3717, n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid, is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (ts) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme. recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of cb 3717 polyglutamates. following a 12-hour exposure of l1210 cells to 50 microm [3h]cb 3717, 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as cb 3717 tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) analyses. as inhibitors of isolated l1210 ts, cb 3717 di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than cb 3717, respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of cb 3717 cytotoxicity. in early clinical studies with cb 3717, activity has been seen in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. toxicities included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. this latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of cb 3717 under acidic conditions. in an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of cb 3717 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way. preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest that a reduction in nephrotoxicity may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients. hepatotoxicity and malaise are again the most frequent side effects. evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients. pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter cb 3717 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved.;0;1;0;1

effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on bupropion hydrochloride-induced seizures in mice.;"background: it is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of bupropion-induced seizures. this is important, since different controlled release formulations of bupropion release the active drug at different rates. methods: we investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion hcl 120 mg/kg, a known convulsive dose 50 (cd50), on the incidence and severity of bupropion-induced convulsions in the swiss albino mice. a total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion hcl 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (ip) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group). bupropion hcl was infused through a surgically implanted ip dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min. the number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded. results: the results showed that ip administration of bupropion hcl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1. logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the ip infusion time of bupropion hcl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection. further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99.8% reduction at 240 min. conclusion: in conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is novel.";0;0;1;0

acute hepatitis attack after exposure to telithromycin.;"introduction: antibiotic-associated hepatotoxicity is rare. with widespread use of antimicrobial agents, however, hepatic injury occurs frequently, and among adverse drug reactions, idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious. case summary: a 25-year-old male patient, with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to marmara university hospital emergency department, istanbul, turkey, with 5 days' history of jaundice, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. he had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg/d po to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior. admission laboratory tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase, 67 u/l (reference range, 10-37 u/l); aspartate aminotransferase, 98 u/l (10-40 u/l); alkaline phosphatase, 513 u/l (0-270 u/l); gamma-glutamyltransferase, 32 u/l (7-49 u/l); amylase, 46 u/l (0-220 u/l); total bilirubin, 20.1 mg/dl (0.2-1.0 mg/dl); direct bilirubin, 14.8 mg/dl (0-0.3 mg/dl); and albumin, 4.7 mg/dl (3.5-5.4 mg/dl). no toxin, alcohol, or other drugs were reported. the patient had suffered a previous episode of ""acute hepatitis of unknown origin,"" that occurred after telithromycin usage. both incidents occurred within a year. discussion: telithromycin is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive us food and drug administration approval for clinical use. it has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction. based on a score of 8 on the naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced toxic hepatitis. recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time. conclusion: here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin.";0;1;0;0
effects of the antidepressant trazodone, a 5-ht 2a/2c receptor antagonist, on dopamine-dependent behaviors in rats.;rationale: 5-hydroxytryptamine, via stimulation of 5-ht 2c receptors, exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas activation of 5-ht 2a receptors enhances stimulated daergic neurotransmission. the antidepressant trazodone is a 5-ht 2a/2c receptor antagonist. objectives: to evaluate the effect of trazodone treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal daergic system. methods: the effect of pretreatment with trazodone on dexamphetamine- and apomorphine-induced oral stereotypies, on catalepsy induced by haloperidol and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), on ergometrine-induced wet dog shake (wds) behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections was studied in rats. we also investigated whether trazodone induces catalepsy in rats. results: trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg i.p. did not induce catalepsy, and did not antagonize apomorphine (1.5 and 3 mg/kg) stereotypy and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy. however, pretreatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p. trazodone enhanced dexamphetamine stereotypy, and antagonized haloperidol catalepsy, ergometrine-induced wds behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections. trazodone at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg i.p. induced catalepsy and antagonized apomorphine and dexamphetamine stereotypies. conclusions: our results indicate that trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg does not block pre- and postsynaptic striatal d2 da receptors, while at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal d2 da receptors. furthermore, at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, trazodone blocks 5-ht 2a and 5-ht 2c receptors. we suggest that trazodone (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), by blocking the 5-ht 2c receptors, releases the nigrostriatal daergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5-ht, and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy.;0;0;1;0
levodopa-induced dyskinesias are improved by fluoxetine.;we evaluated the severity of motor disability and dyskinesias in seven levodopa-responsive patients with parkinson's disease after an acute challenge with the mixed dopamine agonist, apomorphine, before and after the administration of fluoxetine (20 mg twice per day) for 11 +/- 1 days. after fluoxetine treatment, there was a significant 47% improvement (p < 0.05) of apomorphine-induced dyskinesias without modification of parkinsonian motor disability. the dyskinesias were reduced predominantly in the lower limbs during the onset and disappearance of dystonic dyskinesias (onset- and end-of-dose dyskinesias) and in the upper limbs during choreic mid-dose dyskinesias. the results suggest that increased brain serotoninergic transmission with fluoxetine may reduce levodopa- or dopamine agonist-induced dyskinesias without aggravating parkinsonian motor disability.;0;0;1;0
multiple origins for phenylketonuria in europe.;phenylketonuria ( pku ) , a disorder of amino acid metabolism prevalent among caucasians and other ethnic groups , is caused primarily by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) . pku is a highly heterogeneous disorder , with more than 60 molecular lesions identified in the pah gene . the haplotype associations , relative frequencies , and distributions of five prevalent pah mutations ( r158q , r261q , ivs10nt546 , r408w , and ivs12n1 ) were established in a comprehensive european sample population and subsequently were examined to determine the potential roles of several genetic mechanisms in explaining the present distribution of the major pku alleles . each of these five mutations was strongly associated with only one of the more than 70 chromosomal haplotypes defined by eight rflps in or near the pah gene . these findings suggest that each of these mutations arose through a single founding event that occurred within time periods ranging from several hundred to several thousand years ago . from the significant differences observed in the relative frequencies and distributions of these five alleles throughout europe , four of these putative founding events could be localized to specific ethnic subgroups . together , these data suggest that there were multiple , geographically and ethnically distinct origins for pku within the european population . .;0;1;1;0

chemotherapy of advanced inoperable non-small cell lung cancer with paclitaxel: a phase ii trial.;"paclitaxel (taxol; bristol-myers squibb company, princeton, nj) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different tumor types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma. two phase ii trials of 24-hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage iiib or iv non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) reported response rates of 21% and 24%. leukopenia was dose limiting: as many as 62.5% of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia. we investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase ii trial in patients with inoperable stage iiib or iv nsclc. the 58 patients treated (41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years (age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2. most patients (72.4%) had stage iv nsclc. paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication. of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 (24%) had partial remission, 26 (52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression (24%). hematologic toxicities were mild: only one patient (2%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while 29% had grade 1 or 2. grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56% of patients while only one (2%) experienced severe polyneuropathy. similarly, grade 1 or 2 myalgia/arthralgia was observed in 63.2% of patients, but only 14.3% experienced grade 3 or 4. nausea and vomiting were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4. paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. further phase ii studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against nsclc are indicated, and phase iii studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed.";0;0;1;1
a common molecular basis for rearrangement disorders on chromosome 22q11.;the chromosome 22q11 region is susceptible to rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders and malignant tumors . three congenital anomaly disorders , cat-eye syndrome , der ( ) syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome / digeorge syndrome ( vcfs / dgs ) are associated with tetrasomy , trisomy or monosomy , respectively , for part of chromosome 22q11 . vcfs / dgs is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements . in order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements , the deletion end-points in a large number of vcfs / dgs patients were defined by haplotype analysis . most vcfs / dgs patients have a similar 3 mb deletion , some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1 . 5 mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations . the high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements . to investigate this hypothesis , we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from vcfs / dgs patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats , termed lcr22s . to support this idea further , we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 mb region that is deleted in vcfs / dgs patients . we present models to explain how the lcr22s can mediate different homologous recombination events , thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders . we identified five additional copies of the lcr22 on 22q11 that may mediate other rearrangements leading to disease .;1;0;1;1

direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated pacemaker channels by clonidine.;"background: inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine. methods and results: to test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2abc-/-). alpha2abc-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2abc-/- mice by up to 150 bpm. clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2abc-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. a similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2abc-knockout and wild-type mice. clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current (i(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the i(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (hcn) 2 and hcn4 channels in transfected hek293 cells. as a consequence of blocking i(f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2abc-knockout mice. conclusions: direct inhibition of cardiac hcn pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene-targeted mice in vivo, and thus, clonidine-like drugs represent novel structures for future hcn channel inhibitors.";1;0;0;0

glycopyrronium requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of edrophonium.;we have compared, in 60 adult patients, the cardiovascular effects of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 and 10 micrograms kg-1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before edrophonium 1 mg kg-1. significant differences between the four groups were detected (p less than 0.001). both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg-1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min-1 (95% confidence limits 28-32 beat min-1). use of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and, given 1 min before the edrophonium, was sufficient to minimize early, edrophonium-induced bradycardias. this low dose of glycopyrronium provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions.;1;0;1;0

intra-arterial bcnu chemotherapy for treatment of malignant gliomas of the central nervous system.;because of the rapid systemic clearance of bcnu (1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea), intra-arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of malignant gliomas. thirty-six patients were treated with bcnu every 6 to 8 weeks, either by transfemoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable intracarotid drug delivery system, beginning with a dose of 200 mg/sq m body surface area. twelve patients with grade iii or iv astrocytomas were treated after partial resection of the tumor without prior radiation therapy. after two to seven cycles of chemotherapy, nine patients showed a decrease in tumor size and surrounding edema on contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans. in the nine responders, median duration of chemotherapy response from the time of operation was 25 weeks (range 12 to more than 91 weeks). the median duration of survival in the 12 patients was 54 weeks (range 21 to more than 156 weeks), with an 18-month survival rate of 42%. twenty-four patients with recurrent grade i to iv astrocytomas, whose resection and irradiation therapy had failed, received two to eight courses of intra-arterial bcnu therapy. seventeen of these had a response or were stable for a median of 20 weeks (range 6 to more than 66 weeks). the catheterization procedure is safe, with no immediate complication in 111 infusions of bcnu. a delayed complication in nine patients has been unilateral loss of vision secondary to a retinal vasculitis. the frequency of visual loss decreased after the concentration of the ethanol diluent was lowered.;1;1;0;1

milk-alkali syndrome induced by 1,25(oh)2d in a patient with hypoparathyroidism.;milk-alkali syndrome was first described 70 years ago in the context of the treatment of peptic ulcer disease with large amounts of calcium and alkali. although with current ulcer therapy (h-2 blockers, omeprazole, and sucralfate), the frequency of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly, the classic triad of hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal impairment remains the hallmark of the syndrome. milk-alkali syndrome can present serious and occasionally life-threatening illness unless diagnosed and treated appropriately. this article presents a patient with hypoparathyroidism who was treated with calcium carbonate and calcitriol resulting in two admissions to the hospital for milk-alkali syndrome. the patient was successfully treated with intravenous pamidronate on his first admission and with hydrocortisone on the second. this illustrates intravenous pamidronate as a valuable therapeutic tool when milk-alkali syndrome presents as hypercalcemic emergency.;0;1;0;0

clinical experiences in an open and a double-blind trial.;"a total of sixty patients were trated with bromperidol first in open conditions (20 patients), then on a double blind basis (40 patients) with haloperidol as the reference substance. the open study lasted for four weeks; the drug was administrated in the form of 1 mg tablets. the daily dose (initial dose: 1 mg; mean dose at the end of the trial: 4.47 mg) was always administered in one single dose. nineteen patients finished the trial, and in 18 cases the therapeutic result was considered very good to good. these results were confirmed by statistical analysis. nine patients exhibited mild to moderate extrapyramidal concomitant symptoms; no other side effects were observed. the results of detailed laboratory tests and evaluations of various quantitative and qualitative tolerability parameters were not indicative of toxic effects. in the double blind study with haloperidol, both substances were found to be highly effective in the treatment of psychotic syndromes belonging predominantly to the schizophrenia group. certain clues, including the onset of action, seem to be indicative of the superiority of bromperidol. no differences were observed with respect to side effects and general tolerability.";0;0;1;0

succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead-exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure.;background: there is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels. however, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of pb exposure. objectives: the present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of pb poisoning. results: pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in pb-exposed children. succimer treatment of the pb-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit. in contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher pb exposure regimen. conclusions: these are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to pb exposure. these findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in pb-exposed children. however, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of pb or other heavy metals.;0;0;1;0
the identical 5' splice-site acceptor mutation in five attenuated apc families from newfoundland demonstrates a founder effect.;inherited mutations of the apc gene predispose carriers to multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and rectum and to colorectal cancer . mutations located at the extreme 5 end of the apc gene , however , are associated with a less severe disease known as attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( aapc ) . many individuals with aapc develop relatively few colorectal polyps but are still at high risk for colorectal cancer . we report here the identification of a 5 apc germline mutation in five separately ascertained aapc families from newfoundland , canada . this disease-causing mutation is a single basepair change ( g to a ) in the splice-acceptor region of apc intron 3 that creates a mutant rna without exon 4 of apc . the observation of the same apc mutation in five families from the same geographic area demonstrates a founder effect . furthermore , the identification of this germline mutation strengthens the correlation between the 5 location of an apc disease-causing mutation and the attenuated polyposis phenotype . .;0;0;0;1

a diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine.;previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency. the present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. after a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). the animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection). these results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine, possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system.;0;0;1;0
linkage relationships of the apolipoprotein c1 gene and a cytochrome p450 gene (cyp2a) to myotonic dystrophy.;we have studied the genetic linkage of two markers , the apolipoprotein c1 ( apoc1 ) gene and a cytochrome p450 ( cyp2a ) gene , in relation to the gene for myotonic dystrophy ( dm ) . a peak lod score of 9 . 29 at 2 cm was observed for apoc1-dm , with a lod score of 8 . 55 at 4 cm for cyp2a-dm . these two markers also show close linkage to each other ( theta max = 0 . 05 , zmax = 9 . 09 ) . from examination of the genotypes of the recombinant individuals , cyp2a appears to map proximal to dm because in one recombinant individual cyp2a , apoc2 and ckmm had all recombined with dm . evidence from another cyp2a-dm recombinant individual places cyp2a proximal to apoc2 and ckmm . localisation of cyp2a on a panel of somatic cell hybrids also suggests that it is proximal to dm and apoc2 / c1 / e gene cluster .;0;0;1;0
nelarabine neurotoxicity with concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy: case report and review of literature.;severe nelarabine neurotoxicity in a patient who received concurrent intrathecal (it) chemotherapy is reported. a 37-year-old caucasian woman with a history of t-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was admitted for relapsed disease. she was originally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by an autologous transplant. she developed relapsed disease 10 months later with leukemic involvement. she was re-induced with nelarabine 1500 mg/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5 with 1 dose of it cytarabine 100 mg on day 2 as central nervous system (cns) prophylaxis. at the time of treatment, she was on continuous renal replacement therapy due to sequelae of tumor lysis syndrome (tls). she tolerated therapy well, entered a complete remission, and recovered her renal function. she received a second cycle of nelarabine without additional it prophylaxis one month later. a week after this second cycle, she noted numbness in her lower extremities. predominantly sensory, though also motor and autonomic, peripheral neuropathy started in her feet, ascended proximally to the mid-thoracic region, and eventually included her distal upper extremities. a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of her spine demonstrated changes from c2 to c6 consistent with subacute combined degeneration. nelarabine was felt to be the cause of her symptoms. her neuropathy stabilized and showed slight improvement and ultimately received an unrelated, reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant while in complete remission, but relapsed disease 10 weeks later. she is currently being treated with best supportive care. to our knowledge, this is the first published case report of severe neurotoxicity caused by nelarabine in a patient who received concurrent it chemotherapy.;0;1;1;1

coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low-risk patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.;"background: most patients presenting to emergency departments (eds) with cocaine-associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a ""rule out acute coronary syndrome"" protocol, often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge. in patients without cocaine use, coronary computerized tomography angiography (cta) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged. it is unclear whether a coronary cta strategy would be efficacious in cocaine-associated chest pain, as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia. we studied whether a negative coronary cta in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge. methods: we prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary cta for low-risk patients who presented to the ed with cocaineassociated chest pain (self-reported or positive urine test). consecutive patients received either immediate coronary cta in the ed (without serial markers) or underwent coronary cta after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements. patients with negative coronary cta (maximal stenosis less than 50%) were discharged. the main outcome was 30-day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. results: a total of 59 patients with cocaine-associated chest pain were evaluated. patients had a mean age of 45.6 +/- 6.6 yrs and were 86% black, 66% male. seventy-nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ecg and 85% had a timi score <2. twenty patients received coronary cta immediately in the ed, 18 of whom were discharged following cta (90%). thirty-nine received coronary cta after a brief observation period, with 37 discharged home following cta (95%). six patients had coronary stenosis >or=50%. during the 30-day follow-up period, no patients died of a cardiovascular event (0%; 95% ci, 0-6.1%) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction (0%; 95% ci, 0-6.1%). conclusions: although cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction, patients with cocaine associated chest pain, a non-ischemic ecg, and a timi risk score <2 may be safely discharged from the ed after a negative coronary cta with a low risk of 30-day adverse events.";1;0;0;0
canavan disease: genomic organization and localization of human aspa to 17p13-ter and conservation of the aspa gene during evolution.;canavan disease , or spongy degeneration of the brain , is a severe leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase ( aspa ) . recently , a missense mutation was identified in human aspa coding sequence from patients with canavan disease . the human aspa gene has been cloned and found to span 29 kb of the genome . human aspartoacylase is coded by six exons intervened by five introns . the exons vary from 94 ( exon iii ) to 514 ( exon vi ) bases . the exon / intron splice junction sites follow the gt / ag consensus sequence rule . southern blot analysis of genomic dna from human / mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines localized aspa to human chromosome 17 . the human aspa locus was further mapped in the 17p13-ter region by fluorescence in situ hybridization . the bovine aspa gene has also been cloned , and its exon / intron organization is identical to that of the human gene . the 500-base sequence upstream of the initiator atg codon in the human gene and that in the bovine gene are 77 % identical . human aspa coding sequences cross-hybridize with genomic dna from yeast , chicken , rabbit , cow , dog , mouse , rat , and monkey . the specificity of cross-species hybridization of coding sequences suggests that aspartoacylase has been conserved during evolution . it should now be possible to identify mutations in the noncoding genomic sequences that lead to canavan disease and to study the regulation of aspa . .;0;0;1;0
mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine: comparison with exercise-induced ischemia.;the role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease. objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise. both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by st segment depression and angina. however, the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise. exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine-induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. these findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion.;1;0;1;0

effects of nik-247 on cholinesterase and scopolamine-induced amnesia.;the effects of nik-247 on cholinesterase, scopolamine-induced amnesia and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well-known cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and e-2020. nik-247, tacrine and e-2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (ache) in human red blood cells (ic50s = 1.0 x 10(-6), 2.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-8) m, respectively). in addition, nik-247 and tacrine, but not e-2020, strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase (buche) in human serum. all three drugs produced mixed inhibition of ache activity. moreover, the inhibitory effect of nik-247 on ache was reversible. all compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o. significantly improved the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task. the three compounds at 1 and 3 mg/kg p.o. did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats. these findings suggest that nik-247 at a low dose (0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.) improves scopolamine-induced amnesia but does not affect spontaneous movement. the findings suggest that nik-247 may be a useful drug for the treatment of alzheimer's disease.;0;0;1;0

acute liver failure with concurrent bupropion and carbimazole therapy.;objective: to report a case of fatal liver failure possibly associated with concurrent use of bupropion and carbimazole. case summary: a 41-year-old chinese man with a history of hyperthyroidism had been treated with carbimazole and propranolol for the past 5 years. he received a 10-day course of bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation. he developed acute liver failure with rapid deterioration of renal function. liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific drug-induced acute liver injury. his condition was further complicated by sepsis and coagulopathy. death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms. the likelihood that bupropion induced hepatotoxicity in our patient was possible, based on the naranjo probability scale. discussion: although there is increasing evidence of hepatotoxicity induced by bupropion, this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute liver failure in a patient receiving bupropion while on concomitant treatment with carbimazole. conclusions: clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute liver insult induced by bupropion given concurrently with other hepatotoxic drugs.;0;1;1;0

efficacy of everolimus (rad001) in patients with advanced nsclc previously treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and egfr inhibitors.;"background: treatment options are scarce in pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients. rad001, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), has shown phase i efficacy in nsclc. methods: stage iiib or iv nsclc patients, with two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens, one platinum based (stratum 1) or both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stratum 2), received rad001 10 mg/day until progression or unacceptable toxicity. primary objective was overall response rate (orr). analyses of markers associated with the mtor pathway were carried out on archival tumor from a subgroup using immunohistochemistry (ihc) and direct mutation sequencing. results: eighty-five patients were enrolled, 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum. orr was 4.7% (7.1% stratum 1; 2.3% stratum 2). overall disease control rate was 47.1%. median progression-free survivals (pfss) were 2.6 (stratum 1) and 2.7 months (stratum 2). common > or =grade 3 events were fatigue, dyspnea, stomatitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. pneumonitis, probably or possibly related, mainly grade 1/2, occurred in 25%. cox regression analysis of ihc scores found that only phospho akt (pakt) was a significant independent predictor of worse pfs. conclusions: rad001 10 mg/day was well tolerated, showing modest clinical activity in pretreated nsclc. evaluation of rad001 plus standard therapy for metastatic nsclc continues.";0;0;0;1
continuous ambulatory ecg monitoring during fluorouracil therapy: a prospective study.;"although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil (5-fu) therapy, this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion. we prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ecg monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5-fu infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic st changes. patients were monitored for 23 +/- 4 hours before 5-fu infusion, and 98 +/- 9 hours during 5-fu infusion. anginal episodes were rare: only one patient had angina (during 5-fu infusion). however, asymptomatic st changes (greater than or equal to 1 mm st deviation) were common: six of 25 patients (24%) had st changes before 5-fu infusion v 17 (68%) during 5-fu infusion (p less than .002). the incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to 5-fu infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during 5-fu infusion (p less than .001); the duration of ecg changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5-fu v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-fu (p less than .01). ecg changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery disease. there were two cases of sudden death, both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course. we conclude that 5-fu infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent st segment deviation suggestive of ischemia, particularly among patients with coronary artery disease. the mechanism and clinical significance of these ecg changes remain to be determined.";1;0;0;1
mutations of the cathepsin c gene are responsible for papillon-lefevre syndrome.;papillon-lefevre syndrome ( pls ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe early onset periodontitis that results in the premature loss of the primary and secondary dentitions . a major gene locus for pls has been mapped to a 2 . 8 cm interval on chromosome 11q14 . correlation of physical and genetic maps of this interval indicate it includes at least 40 ests and six known genes including the lysosomal protease cathepsin c gene ( ctsc ) . the ctsc message is expressed at high levels in a variety of immune cells including polymorphonuclear leucocytes , macrophages , and their precursors . by rt-pcr , we found ctsc is also expressed in epithelial regions commonly affected by pls , including the palms , soles , knees , and oral keratinised gingiva . the 4 . 7 kb ctsc gene consists of two exons . sequence analysis of ctsc from subjects affected with pls from five consanguineous turkish families identified four different mutations . an exon 1 nonsense mutation ( 856c-- > t ) introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 286 . three exon 2 mutations were identified , including a single nucleotide deletion ( 2692dela ) of codon 349 introducing a frameshift and premature termination codon , a 2 bp deletion ( 2673-2674delct ) that results in introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 343 , and a g-- > a substitution in codon 429 ( 2931g-- > a ) introducing a premature termination codon . all pls patients were homozygous for cathepsin c mutations inherited from a common ancestor . parents and sibs heterozygous for cathepsin c mutations do not show either the palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or severe early onset periodontitis characteristic of pls . a more complete understanding of the functional physiology of cathepsin c carries significant implications for understanding normal and abnormal skin development and periodontal disease susceptibility;0;0;1;0

genomic organization of the adrenoleukodystrophy gene.;"adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) , the most frequent peroxisomal disorder , is a severe neurodegenerative disease associated with an impairment of very long chain fatty acids beta-oxidation . we have recently identified by positional cloning the gene responsible for ald , located in xq28 . it encodes a new member of the "" abc "" superfamily of membrane-associated transporters that shows , in particular , significant homology to the 70-kda peroxisomal membrane protein ( pmp70 ) . we report here a detailed characterization of the ald gene structure . it extends over 21 kb and consists of 10 exons . to facilitate the detection of mutations in ald patients , we have determined the intronic sequences flanking the exons as well as the sequence of the 3 untranslated region and of the immediate 5 promoter region . sequences present in distal exons cross-hybridize strongly to additional sequences in the human genome . the ald gene has been positioned on a pulsed-field map between dxs15 and the l1cam gene , about 650 kb upstream from the color pigment genes . the frequent occurrence of color vision anomalies observed in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy ( the adult onset form of ald ) thus does not represent a contiguous gene syndrome but a secondary manifestation of ald . .";0;0;1;0
genetically determined low c4: a predisposing factor to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.;of 26 patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis ( cah ) starting in childhood 18 ( 69 % ) had low c4 and 5 ( 19 % ) had low c3 serum levels . impaired hepatic synthesis and immune-consumption were unlikely since transferrin levels were normal in all patients , albumin levels were persistently low in only 3 , and only 3 had raised levels of activation fragment c3d . c4d was normal in all patients studied . in the families of 12 probands with low c4 , 7 parents had low c4 and 2 had levels which were at the lower limit of normal . 5 of 10 siblings from 5 families had low c4 . these results suggest that low c4 levels in cah are genetically determined . c4 phenotyping in 20 patients and in 26 parents showed that 90 % and 81 % , respectively , had null allotypes at either the c4a or c4b locus compared with 59 % in controls , indicating that defective expression of structural genes may contribute to the observed c4 deficiency . .;0;1;0;0

different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis.;hepatocyte tight junctions (tjs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation. although hepatocyte tjs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte tj damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. recently, several tj-associated proteins like zo-1 and 7h6 have been identified and characterized. immunolocalization of 7h6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. we used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol (ee) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation (bdl) to precisely determine the site of tj damage. alterations in hepatocyte tjs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7h6 and zo-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. in control rats, immunostaining for 7h6 and zo-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. in contrast, 7h6 and zo-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after bdl. immunostaining for 7h6, not zo-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after bdl. after ee treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7h6 and zo-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after bdl, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. this study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte tjs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after bdl and suggests that bdl and ee treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.;0;1;0;0

paraplegia following intrathecal methotrexate: report of a case and review of the literature.;"a patient who developed paraplegia following the intrathecal instillation of methotrexate is discribed. the ten previously reported cases of this unusual complication are reviewed. the following factors appear to predispose to the development of this complication: abnormal cerebrospinal dynamics related to the presence of central nervous system leukemia, and epidural cerebrospinal leakage; elevated cerebrospinal fluid methothexate concentration related to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and to inappropriately high methotrexate doses based on body surface area calculations in older children and adults; the presence of neurotoxic preservatives in commercially available methotrexate preparations and diluents; and the use of methotrexate diluents of unphysiologic ph, ionic content and osmolarity. the role of methotrexate contaminants, local folate deficiency, and cranial irradiation in the pathogenesis of intrathecal methotrexate toxicity is unclear. the incidence of neurotoxicity may be reduced by employing lower doses of methotrexate in the presence of central nervous system leukemia, in older children and adults, and in the presence of epidural leakage. only preservative-free methotrexate in elliott's b solution at a concentration of not more than 1 mg/ml should be used for intrathecal administration. periodic monitoring of cerebruspinal fluid methotrexate levels may be predictive of the development of serious neurotoxicity.";0;0;1;1

effect of d-glucarates on basic antibiotic-induced renal damage in rats.;dehydrated rats regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection of aminoglycoside antibiotics combined with dextran or of antibiotics only. oral administration of 2,5-di-o-acetyl-d-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone protected rats against renal failure induced by kanamycin-dextran. the protective effect was prevalent among d-glucarates, and also to other saccharic acid, hexauronic acids and hexaaldonic acids, although to a lesser degree, but not to a hexaaldose, sugar alcohols, substances inthe tca cycle and other acidic compounds. d-glucarates were effective against renal damage induced by peptide antibiotics as well as various aminoglycoside antibitocis. dose-responses were observed in the protective effect of d-glucarates. with a d-glucarate of a fixed size of dose, approximately the same degree of protection was obtained against renal damages induced by different basic antibiotics despite large disparities in administration doses of different antibiotics. d-glucarates had the ability to prevent renal damage but not to cure it. rats excreted acidic urine when they were spared from renal lesions by monosaccharides. the reduction effect of d-glucarates against nephrotoxicity of basic antibiotics was discussed.;0;1;0;0

comparison of developmental toxicity of selective and non-selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in crl:(wi)wubr wistar rats--dfu and piroxicam study.;"background: cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy. unlike general toxicity data, their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before. the aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non-selective (piroxicam) and selective (dfu; 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5h)-furanon) cox-2 inhibitors. methods: drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 (gd1=plug day). doses were set at 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0mg/kg for piroxicam and 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0mg/kg for dfu. fetuses were delivered on gd 21 and routinely examined. comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done. the pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (vsd) and midline (md) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non-selective cox-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data. results: maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam. decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the dfu developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose. lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and dfu-exposed groups. prenatal exposure to non-selective cox inhibitors increases the risk of vsd and md when compared to historic control but not with selective cox-2 inhibitors. conclusion: both selective and non-selective cox-2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose. unlike dfu, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams. prenatal exposure to selective cox-2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non-selective drugs and historic control.";0;1;1;0
carvedilol protects against doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy.;several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose-limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin. recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process. the objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties, protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxicity. heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin (2 mg/kg sc/week), carvedilol (1 mg/kg ip/week), or the combination of the two drugs. heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin-treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration (336 +/- 26 versus 425 +/- 53 natom o/min/mg protein) and a lower respiratory control ratio (rcr) (4.3 +/- 0.6 versus 5.8 +/- 0.4) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline-treated rats. mitochondrial calcium-loading capacity and the activity of nadh-dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin-treated rats. doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in rcr for liver mitochondria (3.9 +/- 0.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.7 for control rats) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity. coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver. carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial ca(2+) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by doxorubicin. carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria. it is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose-limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long-term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients.;1;1;1;1
severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation.;we report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection. the donor was a 40-year-old female, first-time apheresis platelet donor. past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. reported medications included bumetanide, pravastatin, and paroxetine. thirty minutes from the start of the procedure, the donor noted tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet. she then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany. empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated, and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes. the events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia. upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia. we conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity. laboratory measurement of pre-procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance. the case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors.;1;0;0;0

acute renal failure occurring during intravenous desferrioxamine therapy: recovery after haemodialysis.;a patient with transfusion-dependent thalassemia was undergoing home intravenous desferrioxamine (dfx) treatment by means of a totally implanted system because of his poor compliance with the nightly subcutaneous therapy. due to an accidental malfunctioning of the infusion pump, the patient was inadvertently administered a toxic dosage of the drug which caused renal insufficiency. given the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and of the laboratory values, despite adequate medical treatment, a decision was made to introduce haemodialytical therapy in order to remove the drug and therapy reduce the nephrotoxicity. from the results obtained, haemodialysis can therefore be suggested as a useful therapy in rare cases of progressive acute renal failure caused by desferrioxamine.;0;1;1;0
gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients: results of the etoricoxib vs diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial (edge-ii).;"objective: a randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (gi) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). patients and methods: a total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with ra were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054). use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was allowed. the prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory gi adverse experiences (aes). general safety was also assessed, including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data. efficacy was evaluated using the patient global assessment of disease status (pgads; 0-4 point scale). results: mean (sd; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively. the cumulative discontinuation rate due to gi aes was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% ci: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)). the incidence of discontinuations for hypertension-related and oedema-related aes were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with diclofenac (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema). etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy (pgads mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively). conclusions: etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to gi aes compared with diclofenac 150 mg. discontinuations from renovascular aes, although less common than discontinuations from gi aes, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.";1;0;0;0
age at diagnosis as an indicator of eligibility for brca1 dna testing in familial breast cancer.;we searched for criteria that could indicate breast cancer families with a high prior probability of being caused by the breast / ovarian cancer susceptibility locus brca1 on chromosome 17 . to this end , we performed a linkage study with 59 consecutively collected dutch breast cancer families , including 16 with at least one case of ovarian cancer . we used an intake cut-off of at least three first-degree relatives with breast and / or ovarian cancer at any age . significant evidence for linkage was found only among the 13 breast cancer families with a mean age at diagnosis of less than 45 years . an unexpectedly low proportion of the breast-ovarian cancer families were estimated to be linked to brca1 , which could be due to a founder effect in the dutch population . given the expected logistical problems in clinical management now that brca1 has been identified , we propose an interim period in which only families with a strong positive family history for early onset breast and / or ovarian cancer will be offered brca1 mutation testing . .;0;0;1;1

irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic nephropathy in f344 rats.;renal papillary necrosis (rpn) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female fischer 344 rats. renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks, when no analgesics were given, to investigate whether the analgesic-induced changes were reversible. there was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix, or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment. the recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage. during the early stages of analgesic treatment, the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible, but after prolonged analgesic treatment, maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover. this study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to rpn. the associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla.;0;1;0;0

relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance in females with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: report from the maternal phenylketonuria collaborative study.;objective  to examine the relationship of phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) genotypes to biochemical phenotype and cognitive development in maternal phenylketonuria ( pku ) . methodology  pah gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the maternal pku collaborative study ( mpkucs ) . a total of 84 different mutations were detected , and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals . based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations , 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity ( severe pku , moderate pku , mild pku , and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [ mhp ] ) . then , 189 mpkucs subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications . the sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity . these patients are considered functionally hemizygous . results  the biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level . cognitive performance ( iq ) was also significantly related to genotype . the iq of pah-deficient mothers with a severe pku mutation in combination with a mhp mutation or a mild pku mutation was 99 and 96 , respectively , whereas the iq of pku mothers with two severe pku mutations or with one severe and one moderate pku mutation was 83 and 84 , respectively . of the patients with pku , 92 % had been treated during childhood . those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average iq scores for their group of mutation combinations . females with moderate or mild pku who were treated early and treated for > 6 years showed iq scores 10 points above average for their group . conclusions  the reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances . both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with pku . the significant relationship among genotype , biochemical phenotype , and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with pku who plan pregnancy . .;0;0;1;0

human mutations in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reflect evolutionary history.;"glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ) is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by a housekeeping x-linked gene whose main function is to produce nadph , a key electron donor in the defense against oxidizing agents and in reductive biosynthetic reactions . inherited g6pd deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia ( triggered by fava beans or other agents ) or life-long hemolytic anemia . we show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene . from the alignment of the amino acid ( aa ) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ) species from 42 different organisms , we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause g6pd deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of g6pd  two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved ( 50-99 % ) aa ; relatively few are in fully conserved aa ( where they might be lethal ) or in poorly conserved aa , where presumably they simply would not cause g6pd deficiency . this is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development . comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein . in view of the current explosive increase in full genome sequencing projects , this tool will become rapidly available for numerous other genes . .";0;0;1;0

stereological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the adult rat.;following status epilepticus in the rat, dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly, and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically, in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation. it has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus. however, the population has never been quantified, so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis. to quantify this population, the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. the number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for prox-1, a granule-cell-specific marker, was estimated using the optical fractionator method. the results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial, and stable over time. interestingly, the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures, because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures. the hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis, although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus. the results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.;0;0;1;0

germline mutations in the 3' part of apc exon 15 do not result in truncated proteins and are associated with attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli.;familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) is an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps predominantly in the colorectal region . germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) gene are responsible for most cases of fap . mutations at the 5 end of apc are known to be associated with a relatively mild form of the disease , called attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( aapc ) . we identified a frameshift mutation in the 3 part of exon 15 , resulting in a stop codon at 1862 , in a large dutch kindred with aapc . western blot analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from affected family members from this kindred , as well as from a previously reported swiss family carrying a frameshift mutation at codon 1987 and displaying a similar attenuated phenotype , showed only the wild-type apc protein . our study indicates that chain-terminating mutations located in the 3 part of apc do not result in detectable truncated polypeptides and we hypothesize that this is likely to be the basis for the observed aapc phenotype . .;0;0;0;1

passage of mannitol into the brain around gliomas: a potential cause of rebound phenomenon. a study on 21 patients.;"aim: widespread use of mannitol to reduce brain edema and lower elevated icp in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so-called rebound phenomenon. leakage of mannitol into the brain parenchyma through an altered bbb and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound . this has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals. as a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of mannitol into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients. methods: mannitol (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant glioma, seven brain metastases and four meningioma) about 30 minutes before craniotomy. during resection, a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample. mannitol concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of blonquist et al. results: in most glioma patients, mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). in meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of mannitol were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells. conclusions: the results of our study show that even after a single bolus, mannitol may leak through the altered bbb near gliomas, reversing the initial plasma-to-blood osmotic gradient, aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of icp.";0;0;1;1

clinical nephrotoxicity of tobramycin and gentamicin. a prospective study.;nearly 3.2 million people in this country receive aminoglycoside antibiotics annually. gentamicin sulfate and tobramycin sulfate continue to demonstrate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in both animal and clinical studies. in this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside-related renal failure, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function. in these 62 patients, no other causes for renal failure could be identified. five of 33 (15%) of the tobramycin-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the gentamicin-treated patients had renal failure. thus, gentamicin was associated with renal failure more than three times as often as was tobramycin.;0;1;0;0
two distinct mutations at a single bamhi site in phenylketonuria.;classical phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( pah ) . the abolition of an invariant bamhi site located in the coding sequence of the pah gene ( exon 7 ) led to the recognition of two new point mutations at codon 272 and 273 ( 272gly----stop and 273ser----phe , respectively ) . both mutations were detected in north eastern france or belgium and occurred on the background of rflp haplotype 7 alleles . the present study supports the view that the clinical heterogeneity in pku is accounted for by the large variety of mutant genotypes associated with pah deficiencies . .;0;1;0;0
coincidence of two novel arylsulfatase a alleles and mutation 459+1g>a within a family with metachromatic leukodystrophy: molecular basis of phenotypic heterogeneity.;in a family with three siblings , one developed classical late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy ( mld ) , fatal at age 5 years , with deficient arylsulfatase a ( arsa ) activity and increased galactosylsulfatide ( gs ) excretion . the two other siblings , apparently healthy at 12 ( 1 / 2 ) and 15 years , respectively , and their father , apparently healthy as well , presented arsa and gs values within the range of mld patients . mutation screening and sequence analysis disclosed the involvement of three different arsa mutations being the molecular basis of intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity . the late infantile patient inherited from his mother the frequent 0-type mutation 459 + 1g > a , and from his father a novel , single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 ( 7delg ) . the two clinically unaffected siblings carried the maternal mutation 459 + 1g > a and , on their paternal allele , a novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8 , resulting in substitution of alanine 464 by valine ( a464v ) . the fathers genotype thus was 7delg / a464v . mutation a464v was not found in 18 unrelated mld patients and 50 controls . a464v , although clearly modifying arsa and gs levels , apparently bears little significance for clinical manifestation of mld , mimicking the frequent arsa pseudodeficiency allele . our results demonstrate that in certain genetic conditions mld-like arsa and gs values need not be paralleled by clinical disease , a finding with serious diagnostic and prognostic implications . moreover , further arsa alleles functionally similar to a464v might exist which , together with 0-type mutations , may cause pathological arsa and gs levels , but not clinical outbreak of the disease . .;0;0;1;0
the effect of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-i on chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy in rats.;we recently demonstrated that recombinant hgh exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (pan) nephropathy, an experimental model of glomerular disease. therefore, we examined whether recombinant human (rh) igf-i is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic pan nephropathy. the glomerulopathy was induced by seven serial injections of pan over 12 wk. experimental animals (n = 6) received rhigf-i, 400 micrograms/d, whereas control rats (n = 6) received the vehicle. rhigf-i improved weight gain by 14% (p < 0.05), without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with renal disease. urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhigf-i treatment in rats with chronic pan nephropathy. after 12 wk, the inulin clearance was higher in rhigf-i-treated rats, 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 ml/min/100 g of body weight in untreated pan nephropathy animals, p < 0.05. the improvement in gfr was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, or renal cortical malondialdehyde content. in rats with pan nephropathy, administration of rhigf-i increased igf-i and gh receptor gene expression, without altering the steady state level of igf-i receptor mrna. in normal rats with intact kidneys, rhigf-i administration (n = 4) did not alter weight gain, blood pressure, proteinuria, gfr, glomerular planar area, renal cortical malondialdehyde content, or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage, compared with untreated animals (n = 4). rhigf-i treatment reduced the steady state renal igf-i mrna level but did not modify gene expression of the igf-i or gh receptors. we conclude that: 1) administration of rhigf-i improves growth and gfr in rats with chronic pan nephropathy and 2) unlike rhgh, long-term use of rhigf-i does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model.;1;1;1;0
